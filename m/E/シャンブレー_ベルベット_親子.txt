You have\nsuch a strong heart, and you listen to it.$k\n$Wsベルベット|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VELVET_EVT_2|Well, I don't know if all our people\nwould agree with your idea...$k$pBut as far as I'm concerned,\nyour words ring true.$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvjSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_25|$SveSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_6|You're the only full-blood taguel still\nalive.

We taguel don't need to\ntalk all the time to learn new things.$k\n$Wsベルベット|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VELVET_EVT_10|Perhaps we should put this insight into\npractice.

No, wait!\nThat would be awful!$k\n$Wsベルベット|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VELVET_EVT_8|...Heh heh, it was only a jape.$k$pSurely our people can appreciate the\nvalue of humor as well?$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_7|No, of course, it's just...\nI wasn't sure you knew what a joke was.$k$p$E笑,|Most of the time you talk as if you\njust ate a sour turnip...or 20!$k\n$Wsベルベット|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VELVET_EVT_11|*Ahem* I've just remembered something\nabout taguel parenting practices.$k$pCorporal punishment is common and often\nadministered with a large, wooden paddle.$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_18|WHAAAT?!
