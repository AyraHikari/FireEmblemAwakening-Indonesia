MID_様子_シンシア_前_親子_子: I would love to know more about your\nfuture, Morgan. Do I end up a big hero?
MID_様子_シンシア_後_親子_子: I mostly just worked on being heroic.\nA blend of power and swagger, you know?$k$pMy big gimmick was that I came from the\nfuture, but that's not so special anymore...$k$pHmm. Maybe I'll be a fighting mama now!\nCould you pretend you're in distress?
MID_様子_シンシア_前_親子_母: Mother, what was your life like before we\nmet? You don't mind telling me, do you?
MID_様子_シンシア_後_親子_母: Even in the future, I wanted to be a hero. I\nthink it stemmed from having a klutzy mom.$k$pBut when it really counted, I wasn't able to\nprotect you. You protected me.$k$pI never forgave myself, so I decided to train\nmyself silly and never let you get hurt again!
MID_様子_シンシア_前_親子_父: It's nice to spend some quality time, Father.\nTell me about your life so far!
MID_様子_シンシア_後_親子_父: My life in the future? Well, I cared for\nMother's pegasus after she...you know.$k$pAnd I trained hard and learned how to fight!\n...It was tough without a dad to teach me.$k$pBut now that we've got the chance,\nwhy don't we practice together?
MID_様子_シンシア_前_恋人: Don't get too close to the front lines,\n$Np. I don't want to lose you!
MID_様子_シンシア_後_恋人: Don't worry. Heroes never die.\nThey keep YOU from dying.
