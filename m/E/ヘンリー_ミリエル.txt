MID_支援_ヘンリー_ミリエル_Ｃ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_ITAZURA1|0|$t1$Wmミリエル|7$Wmヘンリー|3$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Many thanks for your fortuitous\nassistance the other day.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_1|Nya ha ha! No problem. But talk about\nyour strange days!$k$pWhen I saw that big snake on your hat,\nI thought he was a pet.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|The shade under the tree was pleasant,\nand my book terribly absorbing.$k$pTherefore, I failed to notice when the\ncreature undulated down to my position.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_9|Good thing I came along when I did, or\nhe'd have chomped your face but good.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_20|An ophidian of that size is not capable\nof "chomping a face."$k$pHowever, I am curious how you managed\nto dispatch the creature.$k$pYou did not clasp it in your hand, nor\ncast any spell I could fathom.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_6|It was a curse. If I'd used a tome spell,\nyou'd have been in the line of fire, too.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|A curse? Ah, yes. Dark thaumaturgy not\nbased on this world's elemental forms.$k$pI would like to study this skillset further,\nif I may.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_4|Why? Do you have someone\nyou want to curse?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|I'm interested in how such hexes are\nconjured and the theory behind them.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_8|You always have to know exactly how\nthings work, huh?$k$pWant a demonstration? I could turn\n$Nu into a toad or something.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|No. The experiment is not of such import\nthat our comrades need be imperiled.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_5|But it wouldn't be forever!\nJust a few days at the most.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|If we were suddenly called to battle, a toad\ntactician would be most disadvantageous.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_7|Oh yeah. I hadn't thought\nabout that.$k$pWell, maybe I could cast a\ndifferent kind of hex.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|So long as the risk is within\nacceptable parameters.$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ヘンリー_ミリエル_Ｂ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_ITAZURA1|0|$t1$Wmミリエル|7$Wmヘンリー|3$w0|$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvjSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_27|$SveSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_5|I'm sorry, Miriel. But I can't\nshow you any more curses.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|How disappointing. My research\nis nearly ready for peer review.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_12|Yeah, well, $Nu got mad\nat me.$k$p$GHe,She| said I'm not allowed to randomly\ncurse people anymore. Pfft.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|Fortunately, I've already collected enough\ndata to posit a tentative theory of hexing.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_21|You have? That's great!$k$pI cast hexes all the time, and I've never\ncome up with ONE theory about them.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_6|Hex casting is the art of unleashing\nmagic through a series of movements.$k$pIt is the ritual itself that grants efficacy,\nrather than tomes or staves.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_8|Well, yeah, sure. I just never thought\nit was all that exciting.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|Even more fascinating is the extent of your\nown thaumaturgic energy.$k$pIf my calculations are correct, you are able\nto release huge quantities of magical force.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_2|Nya ha ha! Oh, stop it, Miriel!\nYou'll make me blush.$k$pAlthough it's pretty much true. When it\ncomes to hexing folks, I'm the master.$k$pWhy, this one time at mage camp,\nI killed 100 people with one curse!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|I am not privy to the location of this\n"mage camp."$k$pAnd when exactly did this catastrophe\ntake place?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_6|Er, I don't remember when.\n...Or where exactly.$k$pBut it totally could have happened.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|In any case, I am most anxious to\ninvestigate the extent of your powers.$k$pWill you permit me to carry out\nadditional tests and observations?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvjSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_24|$SveSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_2|Sure! You can watch me in\naction for as long as you like.$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ヘンリー_ミリエル_Ａ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_HEIWA1_2|50|$t1$Wmヘンリー|3$w0|$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_12|*Sigh* Aw, dang it. Failed again!\nThis is harder than I thought.$k\n$Wmミリエル|7$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|You seem vexed, Henry.\nIs something amiss?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_11|Well, you know that town we passed\nthrough a few days ago?$k$pI saw a pregnant lady on the main street\nwith a load of cheese and fruit in her arms.$k$pShe looked pretty tired and worn out, so I\nstopped to help her carry her wares.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|I am told parturiency can indeed be a\nmost trying experience.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_8|Right?! Anyway, the more I thought about\nit, the more I realized pregnancy is dumb.$k$pSo I'm planning to help the mothers of\nthe world by inventing a special curse.$k$pI'm gonna create a hex that conjures new\nkids right out of thin air!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|Fascinating.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_6|So if the curse is going to work, I need a\nritual that can generate new life force.$k$pBut I can't find even one. Who knew it\nwould be so hard, when killing is so easy?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|The process of creating life is imbued\nwith mystery and wonder.$k$pMany wise sages have tried to fathom\nthe secret without success.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_21|Gosh. If you and the old wise men don't\nknow how it's done, what hope do I have?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|I would say the odds are remote indeed.$k$pStill, with so much as yet unknown, it may\nprove an intriguing field of study.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_26|Say, if you're as curious as me,\nwhy don't we study it together?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_21|A most meritorious suggestion.$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ヘンリー_ミリエル_Ｓ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_LOVE1|0|$t1$Wmミリエル|7$Wmヘンリー|3$w0|$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_11|Hello, Miriel. How's your research into the\nwhole life-creation thing coming along?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Poorly. It appears this is one mystery\nthat will not easily surrender its secrets.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_8|Yeah, I haven't had much luck myself.\nExcept for one idea...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|Please, enlighten me.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_2|Chrom married a woman and had a child,\nright?$k$pSo, I was thinking you and me could\nmarry and...you know, see what happens.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|Fascinating...$k$pBy experiencing the creation of life\nfirsthand, we might learn to replicate it.$k$pThat kind of immersion research could\nlend itself to a substantial breakthrough.$k$p$E通常,|But are you truly willing to engage in\nsuch a long-term endeavor?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_6|Sure! I think you're the\nbee's knees!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|I find that term difficult to quantify.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_5|Well, how's this? I'm completely\nsmitten with you.$k$pResearch or not, I know I want\nto spend my life with you.$k$pSo how about it? Do you feel\nthe same way?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|I have noticed clammy skin and increased\nheart palpitations in your presence of late.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_20|That sounds like a yes to me!\n...Oh, and here. Take this.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Ah. A ring.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_19|If you wear it, it means we're promised\nto each other forever and ever!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|...Fascinating. The palpitations\nhave returned.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_24|Well, if you're happy, then I'm thrilled!$k$pAnd even if our experiment with creating\nlife doesn't pan out, I'm okay with that.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_21|I see no reason to abandon the research\nsimply because of an espousal.$k\n$Sbs1000|
