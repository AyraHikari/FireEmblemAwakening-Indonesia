Why are you gritting your teeth\nand staring at me like that?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_6|Because the moment I avert my eyes,\nI lose sight of you.$k$pEven when you don't attempt to hide,\nyou simply disappear into thin air.$k$pIt is a most perplexing puzzle.$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_4|It's true that I blend into the\nbackground sometimes...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|But it makes no logical sense.$k$pThat suit of armor you wear reflects\nsunlight like a mirror.$k$pNot to mention the novel nature\nof its oversizedness.$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_11|I think I just lack presence is all.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|By which you mean you are unassertive,\nlaconic, and a man of few words?$k$pThere must be more to it than that.\nScience abhors an incomplete explanation.$k$pHmm...
