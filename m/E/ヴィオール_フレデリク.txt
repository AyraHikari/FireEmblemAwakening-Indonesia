Sophisticated... A perfect match\nfor its owner! Why, it's almost―$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_9|The hilt bears the\nsigil of House Claive.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E苦,|$SvjSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_10|$SveSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_11|Yes, but you\ninterrupted me.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvjSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_24|$SveSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_20|Apologies. ...But it's been troubling me\nfor some time now.$k$p$E通常,|Just how is it you came to hold a dagger\nfrom one of Ylisse's high noble houses?$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_12|I enjoyed a brief but fruitful collaboration\nwith the Claives once upon a time.$k$pWell, specifically with one young and\nVERY beautiful Claive...$k$pShe gave me this blade as a token of our\neverlasting...friendship.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_1|I see. And when exactly did you find the\ntime to foster such a bond?$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_16|Ah, my dear naive Frederick. Not all bonds\ntake equal time to form, you know!$k$pSome are forged in a lifetime, while others\nspring to life in a moment.$k$p$E笑,|...Others still take but one very good night.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E怒,|......$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_4|Oh, please! Spare me the pious air...$k$p$E笑,|But...is that yet a hint of...envy I see as\nwell? Ha! Well, permit me to explain...$k$p$Eキメ,|It is my avocation to grant noble ladies\na brief respite from their dreary lives.$k$pAnd I know of no better way to do so\nthan by romance's sweet perfume.$k$pBut I always acted the gentleman!\nNo harm befell their honor or reputation.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_15|Oh, that was never my concern.$k$pYlisse's noble houses are built of sturdier\nstuff than one dandy's escapades can shake.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_15|Tell me, sir... Do you always smile so as\nyou twist the blade in a fellow's gut?$k$p$E通常,|Yes, well. You wondered at the history of\nmy blade, and now curiosity is slaked.$k$pIf that's quite all, this dandy shall leave\nyou to savor your unshakable honor.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wd$w0|$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_6|...Avocation, he says. Heh.\nQuite the hobby.$k$pYet I bet he has made many other\npowerful allies through such trysts.$k$pDandy or no, the man is sly.\nMethinks he merits watching...$k\n$Sbs1000|

Phew! That's a relief.\nMy apologies for the bother.$k$p$Eキメ,|To think that poor fool would trudge all\nthis way for a mere handful of coins.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_15|$E怒,汗|One would need hands of freakish size\nindeed to cradle that much gold.$k$pPray tell, how does a fellow even begin\nto create such a vast amount of debt?$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_16|My dear sir, there are a thousand ways.\n...Preferably all accomplished at once.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_22|I'll ask no more.

Oh, you flatter me, sir!\n...But do go on.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_9|Mark my words, fox! If your skulking about\never comes to be a burden on Chrom―$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_4|Yes, yes, you'll have my skin for a stole.\nI'm well aware.$k$pI happen to be fond of my skin, so I give my\nword no ill shall come from my deeds.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_34|Keep your word and\nyou'll keep your skin.$k\n$Sbs1000|

And what deeply personal\nmatter will you be prying into today, mmm?$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_15|Perhaps we could talk about a large\nanonymous donation we just received?$k$pI've no doubt you played a part in that.\n...And in truth, we badly needed it.$k$p$Eキメ,|Permit me to offer my thanks, and Chrom's\nin his stead.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_16|You are quite welcome. I was confident\na clever fellow like you would catch on!$k$p$Eキメ,|I doubted Chrom would have accepted\nif I made the offer openly.$k$pEspecially considering the...less-than-\nimmaculate origin of the goods.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_6|Hence the anonymous donation.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_9|Rather genius, wouldn't you say? Elegant!\nSophisticated! A perfect match for―$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_11|But no one will ever\nknow it was you.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_15|Yes, but you're interrupting again.\nWe've had this chat, Frederick!$k$pAh, well. I suppose there's a kind of\nrustic charm to your enthusiasm.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_20|...My apologies.$k$pBut I can't help think that giving so much\nwithout recompense is unlike you.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_7|You wound me, sir!
