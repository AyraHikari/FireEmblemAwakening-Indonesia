Oh, Miriel.\nWhat are you doing here?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_19|Observing.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_4|That conversation just now?$k$pI fear it's hardly anything so grand\nas to merit study.$k$pI merely shared the teachings of Ylisse\nto those villagers eager to listen.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_4|And were they receptive?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_22|I believe that faith will find a home in them.$k$pSuch teachings offer a guide to life and are\na steadfast beacon in these dark times.$k$pI pray it will also sustain them in the lean\ndays ahead.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_10|If the teachings bear such salubrious effect,\nwhy not share them with greater numbers?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_12|Naturally, were it possible, I would\nshare them with everyone!$k$pEr, but why do you bring this up?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|By my observations, your methodology\nis highly inefficient. It vexes me.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_3|Inefficient?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Indeed. Assembling an audience, selecting\nthe venue, promulgating the message...$k$pA scientific approach to these factors\nwould yield a far more efficient modus.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_5|Perhaps, but that isn't―$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|$Eキメ,|Possible? Poppycock. Anything is possible.$k$pGiven a thorough analysis of the germane\nphenomena, a sound theory will emerge.$k$pHowever, in the absence of empirical data,\nyou might dismiss it as idle speculation.$k$pTherefore I must prove it through a\nphysical implementation.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_13|You will do what now?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|I will show that it can be done.$k$pHowever, I fear I am unfit to preach the\nteachings of Ylisse.$k$pIn this capacity, I would enlist your aid.\nI will furnish the mechanism, you the words.$k$pNow, if you'll excuse me, I must begin\nplanning posthaste.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_31|W-wait, Miriel! ...Oh dear.$k\n$Sbs1000|

Your method to spread my\nteachings to a broader audience.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_6|Precisely. A unified fundamental theory\nhas emerged from my investigation.$k$p$Eキメ,|First, the venue must be of sufficient\ncapacity and easily accessed.$k$pBefore speaking, the event must be made\npublic knowledge among nearby villages.$k$pDuring the gathering itself, wind magic is\nto be employed to amplify your voice.$k$pNow then. For the next―$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_8|H-hold on just a moment, Miriel.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|Is something amiss?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_7|Your plan is to gather a large crowd\nand speak to all of them at once?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Quite. In so doing, you mitigate effort and\ntime requirements by the greatest margin.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_5|Yes, but I can't address individual\npeople in such a system.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Nor ought you. Speaking the same words to\nfollowers one by one is hideously inefficient.$k$pGathering them and addressing the lot in\none fell stroke is a far superior plan.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_13|Superior in time and effort spent,\nperhaps, but―$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|The plan will succeed. Further peer\nreview is wholly unnecessary.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_12|...Very well. If you're that certain,\nwe should try it.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvjSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_25|$SveSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_10|I will make manifest the eminence\nof my methodology!$k\n$Sbs1000|

Not exactly, no.$k$pEvery individual listens to the teachings\nof Ylisse for different reasons.$k$pIf I limit my sermons to truths that\napply equally to all, they fall short.$k$pOnly by showing the relevance to each\nperson's life can I truly reach them.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|A logical postulation. Perhaps I was\nindeed myopic in my designs.$k$pWere you certain from the start\nthat my method would fail?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_11|I thought offering salvation to a\nmob would be...difficult, yes.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Then why did you consent to the\nmass gatherings?$k$pOr was I simply too heedless and\nstubborn to hear your objections?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_5|A bit, perhaps.$k$pBut mostly, I thought your plan might\nyield a different sort of benefit.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|And did it?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_18|Indeed it did!$k$pYou've given me the opportunity to meet\nmore people than I ever could have alone!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|Curious.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_30|I had grown rigid in my methods, Miriel―\na lesson I hope you will take to heart.$k$pYour work was a success in terms of\nmeeting converts, but it was only a step.$k$pAnd so I must continue the work that we\nstarted on a more personal level.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_21|There is merit in what you say.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_17|I'm thrilled to hear it.$k$pNow, if you'll excuse me, I'd best head\noff to have some of those conversations.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|I hope you will permit me to offer\nmy continued assistance as well.$k\n$Sbs1000|

I can't thank you enough\nfor all your help of late, Miriel.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|I am glad to be of service.$k$pAnd this has proven a most fruitful\narea of personal study as well.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_3|Oh? What have you learned?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|That any system-built theory is only as\nefficacious as the dedication of the user.$k$pThis is a known scientific truth, but one\nI had yet to learn so viscerally.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_19|The parables hold similar words.\n...Albeit smaller ones.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|This endeavor has sparked a curiosity in\nme to better understand the human heart.$k$pThis will help transport my theories from\nthe realm of abstraction into the tangible.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_4|Perhaps you might begin by examining\nthe contents of my heart?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|I had not planned to do so.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_9|Then perhaps offering you this\nwill spark your curiosity.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|...Ah. A ring. Inductive extrapolation\nsuggests this is a proposal of marriage.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_2|Look into your own heart, Miriel.\nWhat do you find?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|Wonderment and joy in equal parts.\nOr so it would seem.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_11|And do the contents of your heart\nmove you to accept this ring?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_17|The sum of its contents provide an\nunequivocally affirmative response.$k$pStill, it is most curious. These sensations\nare demonstrably real, but hardly logical.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_30|A fine subject for further\ninvestigation.$k$pI'll have to make sure you never\nlack for future data!$k\n$Sbs1000|
