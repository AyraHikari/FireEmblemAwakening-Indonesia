Busy training?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_3|Just taking practice swings.\nNothing fancy.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_5|Ah, yes.

Massages are for princesses!\nI just need to work through it.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_21|Inadvisable. You would be far better served\nseeking legitimate treatment.$k$pAs the lower back muscles drive the entire\nbody, they are indispensable to combat.$k$pThey are also slow to heal. If ignored,\nyour condition may worsen.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_13|All right, fine. I'll get a massage!$k$pMaybe paint my nails while I'm\nat it... *grumble, grumble*$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|I hope it serves you well.\nDo take care.$k\n$Sbs1000|

Thanks.\nIt was a big help.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_10|$E笑,|Please, do not give it another thought.$k$pI consider it a part of my duties to keep\nwatch for any anomalies.$k$pIf I can be of assistance in keeping this\narmy in top condition, I shall do so.$k$pAnd that means scrutinizing every last\ntick, movement, and gesture.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|...You do what now?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|Er, have I said anything amiss?\nYour face is most scrunchy.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_13|No, no.

Constantly watching.\nIs that a problem?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|Not a problem, I guess, but it is\nkind of...creepy. Like a...stalker.$k$pLook, you should be careful you don't\nmake anyone feel uncomfortable, okay?$k$pSome people don't enjoy being watched.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|Er, I see.

Hello, Laurent.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|Kjelle.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_5|You haven't been by to check up on me\nin a while. Is everything all right?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|What?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_10|You said it was your duty to keep watch on\nus. Keep us in top condition and all that?$k$pAnd then you just stopped coming by.\nI wondered if you'd given up or what.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_6|I still watch everyone else.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|Everyone...else?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|After you cautioned me, I thought it best if\nI made an exception for you, so I desisted.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_2|Because I told you other people may\nnot like you staring at them?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|"Some people" were your words. I thought\nperhaps you were speaking for yourself.$k$pIt is not uncommon for people to cloak\ntheir fears in the guise of an imaginary―$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_3|Oh, for hell's sakes! That's not what\nI was doing!$k$pI just meant that SOME people might\ntake offense. That's all I meant.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_10|Is it?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_8|Yes, it is! If it bothered me, I'd have told\nyou to knock it off because it bothers me.$k$pSometimes you're too smart for your own\ngood. Stop overthinking everything!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_18|...My apologies. I see my inference\nwas mistaken.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_6|Your advice has already helped me out.\nI'm a big fan of your advice.$k$p$Eキメ,|So I was HOPING you'd keep watching.$k$pIf anything looks off to you, point it out.\nI'd be eager to hear it.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_5|Then I shall strive to let no glimmer of\npotential improvement elude me!$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_20|You do that.$k\n$Sbs1000|

Ought I be concerned\nthat the sight of me sends you reeling?$k$pI would gladly lend an ear to any troubles\nyou may be having.$k$pAnd troubles I am the cause of, doubly so.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_14|No, you're fine. It's me.\nI...need to apologize.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|Oh?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_5|I snapped at you before. When you stopped\ncoming by to check up on me?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|I would not categorize your behavior\nas "snapping."$k$pWhat's more, I thought the matter was\ndecided as a misunderstanding on my part.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_10|...It wasn't.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_6|I fear I don't understand.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_6|That was... I was jealous.$k$pYou started watching everyone but me,\nand it... It made me a little crazy.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|...Now I really do not understand.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_9|Believe me, I'm as shocked as you.$k$pAnd I'm still confused about what it all\nmeans. What I feel for you...$k$pBut I wasn't being honest with you,\nor with myself. That much is clear.$k$pSo I wanted to go ahead and apologize for\nthat, no matter what happens down the line.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_5|If I may confirm...$k$pYou feel it's possible―but not definite―\nthat you bear an affection for me?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_13|...Yes.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|And you see the potential for growth into\nsome form of relationship "down the line"?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_14|Sorry. I know it's all pretty vague.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_17|I see no call for apology.\nThis is a welcome development.$k$pFor I am quite certain in my affections\nfor you, Kjelle.$k$pAnd as a by-product of possession, jealousy\nis a favorable addition to the equation.$k$pAfter all, the ultimate goal here is\nto be possessed, is it not?$k$pStill, I must say, the frank compulsion to\napologize immediately is very you. Ha.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,照|Laurent...$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_6|You have asked me to continue\nto watch you, Kjelle.$k$pI would now ask you to do the same.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|Well, sure, but... How do you mean?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_16|I've only just begun to show my worth\nas a possible spouse and mate.$k$pHowever, I still have work to do before I am\nwhat the layman might call "dreamy."$k$pBut given proper training, I am confident\nin my ability to steal your heart.$k$pTherefore, I would ask that you observe\nme in this process and offer advice.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_20|...Er, you want me to watch\nyour "dreamy" training?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_19|That is it exactly.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_23|Well, I've had worse offers...$k\n$Sbs1000|
