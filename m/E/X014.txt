The sands are home\nto armed barbarians.$k$pEvery year sees a few villagers go chasing\nthe myth and finding the grave instead.$k$pI'll not stop you, but be sure you're\nwell armed and fully prepared.$k
MID_X014_OP2: $t1$WmX014_ボス|3$w0|$WsX014_ボス|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_BOSS3_EVT_1|$E笑,|Here we are, boys! The golden oasis!$k$pThey say the villages around here are\nfilled to burstin' with rare treasure!$k$p$E怒,|$WvKick down every door ya see!\nDon't let a single coin slip by!$k
MID_X014_VIL1: $t1$Wm自分|3$Wm村長|7$w0|$Ws村長|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_VIRREGER4_EVT_1|Well, well. This village does not often\nplay host to outsiders...$k$pFew hold faith in that which cannot be seen\nto exist, yet I sense such faith in you.$k$pHere, then.\nClaim what you have come for.$k$pI hold my own faith that you will use\nit with wisdom.$k
MID_X014_VIL2: $t1$Wm自分|3$Wmロラン|7$w0|$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|$E通常,|That mirage village must be located\nvery near to here...$k$pThough I fear my own search for it\nhas borne naught but ill fruit.$k$p$E苦,汗|No doubt Mother would have this mystery\nunraveled in moments, were she here...$k
MID_X014_VIL2_02: $t1$Wmクロム|3$Wmロラン|7$w0|$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_1|$E通常,|Chrom? Is that you?$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_3|$E怒,|Er, yes. And you are...?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_4|$E通常,|Ah, apologies! I am Laurent,\na traveling mage and scholar.$k$pAnd perhaps more saliently,\nI am Miriel's son.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_12|$E通常,|Wait, you mean OUR Miriel?$k$pOh, right. So then you must have\ntraveled back and... Er, right?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_16|$E笑,|Excellent! Your comprehension spares me\nthe botheration of further explication.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_7|$E笑,|...Yep. You're Miriel's kid all right.$k$pSo have you come all this way\nin search of your mother?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|$E通常,|Just so. She wrote of a mirage\nvillage in one of her records.$k$pI thought it might offer some clue\nto her current whereabouts.$k$pAnd acquiring the Goddess Staff\nis a worthy motive, besides.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_8|$E通常,|Any luck with that?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_9|$E怒,|Nay, sir. Much to my vexation,\nstaff and village both elude me.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_3|$E怒,|I suppose it wouldn't be a legend if you\ncould just stumble upon it in the market.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|$E笑,|Well put! And yet, not all is lost.\nMeeting you here is success enough.$k$pI was quickly reaching the limits of\nwhat one man can do alone.$k$p$E通常,|Might I lend my might to your cause?\nI assure you I will not be a burden.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_9|$E笑,|Of course. We'd love to have you.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|$E笑,|Excelsior!$k

It's you!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|$E通常,|...Curious. I have no recollection\nof making your acquaintance.$k$pThough few things are as unreliable\nas the human memory.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_4|$E笑,|Ah, forgive me. I forgot that\nyou have not met me before.$k$p$E通常,|My name is Laurent. Are you here\nin search of the mirage village?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|That is my cause, yes.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_10|Mine as well, though I fear my efforts\nthus far yield precious little progress.$k$pStill, an excess of evidence exists for the\nvillage to be baseless rumor alone...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|An assumption on your part, that.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_6|Might I accompany you in your search?$k$pI feel certain that your help will lay exposed\nthat which has eluded me alone.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Mmm. I worry your hypothesis lacks\na certain scientific rigor...$k$pAnd yet, there exists the possibility\nI am in error on this count...$k$pSo...yes. You are welcome to join us.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_17|$E笑,|Excelsior! I assure you, I'll not be a burden.$k
MID_X014_VIL3: $t1$Wm自分|3$Wm村長|7$w0|$Ws村長|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_VIRREGER4_EVT_7|$E通常,|Not many make it out this far. You must\nbe near exhausted from the sands.$k$pHere, then. Take this as a reward\nfor your efforts.$k$p...A mirage village? No, I'm afraid we're\nquite the ordinary one! Ha ha ha!$k$pPerhaps you'll find what you seek\nfurther west...$k
MID_X014_VIL4: $t1$Wm自分|3$Wm村長|7$w0|$Ws村長|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_VIRREGER4_EVT_7|$E通常,|Not many make it out this far. You must\nbe near exhausted from the sands.$k$pHere, then. Take this as a reward\nfor your efforts.$k$p...A mirage village? No, everyone\ncan see us just fine! Ha ha ha!$k$pPerhaps you'll find what you seek\non the far side of the oasis...$k
MID_X014_VIL5: $t1$Wm自分|3$Wm村長|7$w0|$Ws村長|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_VIRREGER4_EVT_7|$E通常,|Not many make it out this far. You must\nbe near exhausted from the sands.$k$pHere, then. Take this as a reward\nfor your efforts.$k$p...A mirage village? Yes, my mum used to\nsing cradle songs of such a thing.$k$p"Find the last tree north of the oasis shore...\nThen two steps north and one step more!"$k$pEr, or something like that. It's not like\nthe place really exists, anyway.$k
MID_X014_EV1: $t1$Wmクロム|3$w0|$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_11|$E通常,|The battle is won, and the sun is fading.\nWe'd best make tracks.$k
MID_X014_ED1: $t1$Wmusername|7$Wmクロム|3$w0|$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_6|$E通常,|Just what was that place, in the end?\nSomething beyond our ken, I suppose...$k$pMaybe a small proof that faith, even in\nthe intangible, can still be rewarded?$k$pLike faith in a better future, perhaps.\n...Heh. That's treasure enough for me.$k
MID_X014_ED2: $t1$Wmusername|3$Wmクロム|7$w0|$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_6|$E苦,汗|It seems the mirage remains just that...$k$p$E通常,|Best we returned our focus to the\nreal world. Let's press on.$k
MID_X014_ED3: $t1$Wmロラン|3$Wmミリエル|7$w0|$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_6|$E通常,|Might I have a word?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|$E通常,|I don't see why not.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|$E苦,汗|Tell me honestly―how would\nyou assess my performance?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|You have certain natural deficiencies,\nbut you compensate for them well.$k$pI surmise this is the product of\nconsiderable time and effort.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_16|$E笑,|Hah! The best response yet!$k$pYou're as perspicacious as\nyou are blunt, Mother.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Mother?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|$E通常,|Indeed. I am your future progeny.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_10|$E怒,|Do you have concrete evidence to\nsubstantiate this proposition?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|I have a ring which is the same as yours.\nQuite literally.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|$E通常,|...Fascinating. It does appear identical.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|Do two instances of a unique object\ncoexisting constitute sufficient proof?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_4|To be sure, time travel is one viable\nhypothesis to explain the rings.$k$pBut the possibility also exists that you\npilfered the ring from said time traveler.$k$pAs a means of identification,\nI fear it inconclusive.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|$E苦,汗|...An astute criticism.$k$pI'm uncertain that any truly conclusive\ncase can be mounted to prove my claim.$k$p$E通常,|But I intend to spend the rest of my life\ninvestigating the matter, if necessary.$k$p$E笑,|A single-minded pursuit of the truth\nmay be the best proof of my heredity.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|This is a reasonable assumption.$k$p$Eキメ,|But I'm afraid a unilateral investigation\nis hardly credible.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|$E通常,|Then how should―$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|$E通常,|However, I have no material evidence to\nsuggest you are not, as you claim, my son.$k$pI shall conduct an inquiry of my own.$k$pWe'll investigate the matter until a clear\nconclusion emerges. ...Together.$k$p$E笑,|Until then, I will grant the fundamental\nassumption that you are, in fact, my child.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_17|$E笑,|...Thank you, Mother.$k
