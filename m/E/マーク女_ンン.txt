Morgan, I was... I was hoping\nno one would see me.$k$pI'm training in secret to overcome\nmy one critical weakness.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_10|You have a weakness? Seriously?$k$pBut, um, you're a dragon.\nHow can you have a weakness?$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_5|Unfortunately, there is a rare subset of\nweapons that are a bane to my kind...$k$p$E怒,|Wyrmslayers.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_29|Oh, right! The swords said to cleave\neven the mighty scales of a manakete.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_1|Correct. So to defend against it,\nI'm training in the art of blade grasping.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_5|Blade what-ing?$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_9|Grasping. It's a foreign technique used\nby the greatest of swordmasters.$k$pYou stop the opponent's sword midswing\nby clasping it between your open palms.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_18|That seems really...hard.\nLike impossible hard.$k$pStill, I guess it would be a pretty good\nway to stop a Wyrmslayer, if you could.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_15|Yes, I know. But I'm having a\ndifficult time figuring it out.$k$pMaybe I just don't have what it takes...$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_42|No, Nah! It's way too early to give up\non something so completely awesome!$k$pIn fact, I'm gonna help you train!$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_10|Huh? Really?$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_36|I don't know much about swordplay,\nbut two heads are better than one, right?$k$pJust let me know what I can do!$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_25|Thanks, Morgan! That's very\ngenerous of you.$k$pOkay, then. Why don't you attack me,\nand I'll try to catch your strike.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_44|All right, got it! We'll start with a\nbare-handed chop. Ready?$k$p...Yah!$k\n$w200|$SspSE_EVT_PUNCH1|$w500|$Wsンン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_16|Ow! That hurt!$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_26|Aah! Sorry! I'm sorry, Nah!$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_12|If I can't even stop that, it's going to be a\nlong time before I'm stopping swords...$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_46|You'll get it. I'm sure of it!\nJust take it one step at a time.$k$pTogether, we'll be unstoppable!$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_22|Aw, thanks, Morgan!$k\n$Sbs1000|

That's ten in a row!$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_4|Yay!$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_44|$E怒,|How about this? ...Yah!$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_29|Hah!$k$p...Muh?!$k$p$E通常,汗|Wait, what happened?\nDid I miss?$k\n$Wc$w500|$SspSE_EVT_PUNCH1|$w700|$Wsンン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_16|...Gah!$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_26|Oops!

That sounds a lot more painful\nthan a bare-handed chop.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_36|That's the point!\nIt'll be a good incentive.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_6|Also, is it okay to be smacking me\nin the face with a magical tome?$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_46|This is serious training!\n...The tomes will understand.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_14|...Erm, all right.\nGo for it, then!$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_31|Here comes!$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_22|Ready!$k\n$Sbs1000|
