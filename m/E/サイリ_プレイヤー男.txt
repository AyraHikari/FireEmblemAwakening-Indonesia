I've never seen\nanything like it. Where did you get it?$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_6|This? It's a common enough sight in\nChon'sin. All warriors wear a variation.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_21|The shape is unusual, but clever in its\ndesign. The plating looks tough as well.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_3|Hardened lacquer. It keeps the armor light\nwhile providing excellent defense.$k$pIt's quite rare to see heavy armor where I\ncome from.$k$pAnd we wield a curved, single-edged blade\nin both hands, so we do not carry shields.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_23|That's a far cry from what I'm used to...\nAre there any other important differences?$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_6|Aye, a world's worth, sir!$k$pYou'd find much of Chon'sin culture curious.\nFood, dress...most everything.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_19|I'd love to hear more sometime.\n...If you don't mind, that is.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_5|Of course. I would be honored. Talk of my\nhomeland keeps it close to my heart.$k\n$Sbs1000|

'Twas only recently\nthat first I tasted bread or cheese.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_18|Interesting.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_22|Raw fish is also a Chon'sin delicacy.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_7|...Raw? Is it any good?$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_6|Quite so, provided the fish is fresh.\nIf not...well, it can be an ugly sight indeed.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_23|Seems our foods are as different as our\nweapons and armor.$k$pIt must have been difficult to grow\naccustomed to life in the camp.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_4|I find your cuisine quite palatable, in truth.\nThough I do miss the tastes of home.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_17|I'd love to try it myself someday.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_6|Aye!
