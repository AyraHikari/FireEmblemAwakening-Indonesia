What'll it be?\nJust say the word.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_18|I recall seeing you eat bear with great\nrelish shortly after we first met.$k$pI should like you to teach me this skill.\n...Eating bear, that is.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_13|I remember that night! Lissa was in a froth.\nSaid it smelled like...old boots, was it?$k$pWait, so you didn't eat any, either?$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_16|I fear I've rarely been able to choke down\nwild game, and bear least of all.$k$pBut as the war grows harsher, I can no\nlonger afford to be picky.$k$pThere may come a day when bear is the\nonly food available to us.$k$pBest I train to overcome my aversion\nnow, when our situation is not so dire.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_23|True, and even the finest knight isn't\nmuch use on an empty stomach...$k$pAll right then, you're on.

Don't worry about it.$k$pSo, Frederick. You don't have a problem\nwith more common meats, do you?$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_16|Beef and pork are fine. I also enjoy\na good chicken on occasion.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_21|Then let's start simple.\nTake a bite of this jerky.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_4|I shall tear into it with gusto!\n*munch, munch*$k$p$E苦,汗|BLEAGH! G-gamey! S-so gamey!\nWhat... *cough* What IS this?!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_35|It's bear. Leftovers from the same bear\nwe ate that night, in fact! I saved some.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_29|Eeeaaaaagh! Healer! I need a healer!$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wd$w0|$Wsusername|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_9|Animal or savage, indeed.\nHow rude of him...$k$pGuess he wasn't joking about\nhis aversion to bear, though...$k\n$Sbs1000|

I thought you were serious about\ngetting over this, Frederick.$k$pLook, I'm not a monster. I prepared a whole\nseries of meats in order of gaminess.$k$pWe can take it slow.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_20|...Well, I suppose I did ask for this.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|All right then.
