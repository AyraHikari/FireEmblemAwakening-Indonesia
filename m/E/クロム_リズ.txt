I talked to everyone.$k$pI asked them all how I could be a\nbetter princess, just like you asked.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_7|And what did they say?$k\n$Wsリズ|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LIZ_EVT_17|A dozen different things!$k$pSome guy said I should be more calm and\nstop throwing tantrums.$k$pAnother person said I should stop being so\npicky about what I eat, which was weird.$k$pOh, and a certain someone told me to stick\nmy pinky out when I drink tea.

What did you hear the most?$k\n$Wsリズ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LIZ_EVT_18|Um... Well, there were a whole lot of\npeople who said "nothing."$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_8|So there you have it.$k\n$Wsリズ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LIZ_EVT_12|There I have what?$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_2|I told you you're fine just as you are,\ndidn't I?

I still don't feel like I'm\ncontributing anything.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_6|When you approached people, how did they\nreact? And I mean before you said anything.$k$pI'd bet good coin they all smiled at you.\n...Right?$k\n$Wsリズ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LIZ_EVT_19|What? No, they... Hmm...\nYeah, I guess they did.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_13|You make people happy, Lissa. You motivate\nand inspire them just by your presence.$k$pI might instill confidence, but I don't make\nthem happy. And neither would Emmeryn.$k\n$Wsリズ|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LIZ_EVT_26|You think so?$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_9|I KNOW so. And believe me, that talent is\nmore useful than you'd think.$k$pEveryone else knows it, too. That's why\nthey told you not to change a thing.$k$pSo if you won't trust my opinion, how about\ntheirs? You're their princess, after all.$k\n$Wsリズ|$Wa$E困る,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LIZ_EVT_18|N-no, I trust them. I do, but...$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_11|Then stop worrying!$k$pYou're going to be a princess all your life.\nThat's plenty of time to figure it out.$k$pJust be yourself and the rest will come\nnaturally.$k\n$Wsリズ|$Wa$E笑,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_LIZ_EVT_20|...Huh.
