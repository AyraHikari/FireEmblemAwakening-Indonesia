I'm sure anything you have\nto say would be tremendously helpful.$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_8|As this army's tactician, you hold its\nfate in your hands.$k$pIf the knowledge I've amassed can be\nof use, I'm pleased to help.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|Then I humbly accept your offer.$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_7|Right, then! Let us begin.$k$pFirst, all strength stems from a\nwarrior's breathing.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_11|Oh?$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_5|By drawing in the ambient energies that\npermeate the air, we gain their strength.$k$pTherein lies the origin of a fighter's ability\nand the determinant to how far they'll go.$k$pSo, if the breath is the source of all\nstrength, what ought a warrior do?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_10|Um... Seek out the purest air possible?$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_17|Indeed!$k$pAir quality is of critical importance when\ntraining.$k$pThis is why warriors have labored in deep\nwoods and under waterfalls for ages.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_18|I didn't expect you to be quite\nso...intense. This is pretty heady stuff.$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_7|You want intense? Let's talk about my\nfirst training expedition in the woods.$k$pI was but a boy, 11 or 12 perhaps,\nand I was attacked by a ferocious bear!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_29|A bear attacked you when\nyou were 12?!$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_5|It did.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_8|So...did you defeat it?$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_19|A foolish question!$k$pHow else would I be telling you\nthis blistering tale if I hadn't?!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_13|...Oh. Um, right. $k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_8|I owe my victory to the crisp mountain air.$k$pWith every breath, I drew into me the very\nspirit of the woods.$k$pThe sighs of trees ages old whorled about\nme just waiting to be utilized!$k$pAnd as I breathed deep, I began to refine\nthat energy. To temper it...$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_11|$E通常,汗|It's really something seeing you get\nso excited... You're usually so quiet.$k$pBut, er, is there an end to this story?\n...In the near future?$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_4|Hmm? Did you say something?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_14|Er, no... Not a thing.$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_20|Anyway, yes, my story...$k$pSo by fusing the air with my own intrinsic\nenergies and releasing it, I created a new...$k\n$Sbs1000|

A spear tip\nhewn to a razor point!$k$pThey're strong enough to take a life, but\nexquisitely fragile at the same time.$k$pA warrior's life extends no further than\nthat of the weapon he wields.$k$pFail to perform maintenance, and it\nmay well cost you...EVERYTHING!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_11|Sounds like something you might say...\nA stern maxim to live by, but fair.$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_8|Ideally, a weapon would never be\nhandled save by the one who wields it.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_5|Er, so I shouldn't help the others\nmaintain their equipment?$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_5|I mean only that creating and tending to a\nweapon aids in growing accustomed to it.$k$pTo claim as one's own a weapon made\nand honed by another is folly!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_23|Doesn't it seem a bit much to have an\nentire army learn smithing?$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_7|It is only an ideal. I would never presume\nto force my methods on anyone else.$k$pBut a man must have a code,\nand this is mine!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_10|Wow, Priam. Anything about war and\nweapons and you get worked up.$k$pI had you pegged as the strong, silent type,\nbut you're actually quite passionate.$k$p$E苦,汗|(Though I might've preferred the strong-\nand-silent version, emphasis on silent...)$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_4|Hmm? What was that?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_13|...Nothing at all.$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_8|Legends from the far north say that blades\nhandled with love ultimately gain souls.$k$pThey cease to be mere objects and become\nsomething tremendous.

Priam! Must you keep sneaking\nup on me, only to yell in my ear!$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_7|How else would I convey to you my\nthoughts on food and its role in war?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_5|...Oh boy. You've got a\nphilosophy of eating, too?$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_5|$Eキメ,|Of course! Food is another cornerstone of\na warrior's physical and mental training.$k$pThe act of eating is to take the life of other\nbeings and make it into one's own flesh.$k$pThat's why wasting food is a crime on par\nwith murder itself!$k$pWe should eat with an awareness of the\nsacrifices of others and a spirit of thanks.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_11|Awfully talkative again today,\naren't we, Priam?$k$p(...Now where did I put that\ncotton for my ears...?)$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_4|...Mmm?

I guarantee it.$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_11|A guarantee from you is\na serious thing indeed.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|I do feel you've grown a bit...kinder.\nEven gentler, perhaps.$k$pBut this is not a bad thing. In fact,\nit's helped our army.$k$pFor example, passing along your wisdom\nto me was an act born of kindness, no?$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_7|Well, I suppose I did want to feel I was\ndoing all I could to help everyone...$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_18|It makes me all the more eager to learn\nhow I might follow in your footsteps.$k\n$Wsパリス|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PARIS_EVT_5|Heh, fair enough! Then I'll continue to\nteach you everything I know.$k$pIf you think you can handle it, that is?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_17|Of course!
