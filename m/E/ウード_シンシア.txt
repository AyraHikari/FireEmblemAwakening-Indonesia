Did you need something, Owain?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_8|Nothing so grand. I just hadn't seen\nyou for a while.$k$pI miss my Justice Cabal companion!$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_5|Ha! I remember when we used to play\nJustice Cabal as kids!$k$pRemember how I always played at being\nBeano the Barbarian Queen? Hee hee!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_20|Ha ha! I never did understand where\nyou got that name! Good times...$k$pSo, uh, what're you up to now?$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_18|That's classified information, mister.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_9|Aw, come on. You can tell me.\nI'm in the Justice Cabal!$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_17|Okay, fine. But this is just between us!$k$pSo I'm trying to plan a dramatic entrance\nfor our next battle. Something...heroic.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_15|Well, if you're going to be a hero,\nthere's only one real option...$k$pWait until your friends are on the brink of\ndefeat, then show up and smite the enemy!$k$pThere's nothing more heroic than\na big comeback.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_20|That's terrible! I can't do that!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_4|Why not? A hero always shows up at the\nlast minute. It's in the job description.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_21|No, it's not! A real hero is there the whole\ntime, tirelessly defending her allies!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_14|Noooo, I'm pretty sure a hero has to show\nup and save everyone at the very end.$k$p...Huh. Weird. We always agreed on this\nkind of stuff before.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_5|Maybe that's what happens\nwhen you grow up?$k\n$Sbs1000|

Do you remember\nwhat we talked about before?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_9|The perfect heroic entrance? Sure!$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_2|Well, I've been thinking about what\nyou said, and it still feels wrong.$k$pYou want me to wait and appear at the\nend, but what if someone needs me?$k$pWhat if they get hurt? Or...worse?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_13|$E怒,|That's the whole point! You come swooping\nin just before anyone gets hurt!$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_20|$E怒,|But what if you're too late?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_16|$Eキメ,|Just don't let it happen. Situational\nanalysis is a basic part of heroism.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_9|Mmm, it's still a risk. I think I'd rather\njust be there from the beginning.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_23|$E怒,|Yeah, but you know what? Even if the worst\nDOES happen, I'd still be heroic!$k$pI'd slowly walk up to the crumpled body\nof my comrade...$k$pI'd stoop low and gently brush their bloody\nand matted hair from their face...$k$pAnd I'd say...$k\n$Wsシンシア|$WaYes? Yes?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_27|$WvBY THE GODS, I SHALL AVENGE YOU!$k$pAnd then, clutching their lifeless form tight,\nI'd burst into flames!$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_12|$E苦,汗|You'd what?!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_25|I become death incarnate! Friend and\nfoe alike fall before my rampage!$k$pDriven mad by grief, I am an unstoppable\nengine of blood rage and destruction!$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_15|Geez, Owain! Have you gone batty?!$k$pAnd a hero should protect people,\nnot go on crazy rampages!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_22|By the time I regain my senses,\nit is already too late...$k$pA ravaged land stretches before me,\nits soil stained red with blood.$k$pI stand in silence, alone, with only the\nhorror of my thoughts for company...$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_1|Owain? Hey, Owain! Snap out of it!$k\n$Sbs1000|

You wanna hear how\nthe story ends?$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_1|You mean the one where you go\ncrazy with grief and kill everyone?$k$pI'm not sure I wanna hear how\nthat one ends, honestly...$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_22|It's not going crazy!\n...It's me entering Avenger Mode.$k$pAAAAAANYWAY...$k$pI continue to be wracked with guilt\nand rage over my actions!$k$pI fall into Avenger Mode again and again,\nalways regretting it, but powerless to resist.$k$pThe stench of blood never leaves my\ncrimson-stained hands.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_15|You know, I've been meaning to tell you\nthere's nothing heroic about this story.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_4|But then a heroine appears to stop\nmy tortured onslaught!$k$pIt's...Cynthia! Cue the harps and bells!$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_9|Hey! I want no part of this!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_23|The strong but fair Cynthia will stop at\nnothing to end my mad reign of terror!$k$pAnd end it she does, though she pays\nthe ultimate price...$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_12|Wait―I DIE?!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_25|Your selfless sacrifice teaches me to\nquell my rage and control Avenger Mode.$k$pWith that lesson forever in my heart, I\nbecome an inexorable force for justice.$k$p...And that's the origin of Owain Dark,\nAvenging Avenger of Justice!$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_20|Wait a second! Go back to the part\nwhere you kill me!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_8|Ah ha ha! Sorry, Cynthia. I got carried\naway by my own awesomeness!$k$pMan...maybe I should write novels.\nYou know, once the war is over.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_8|Just make sure I stay alive long\nenough to read them, all right?$k\n$Sbs1000|

You need something?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_7|Remember when we were talking\nabout what makes a hero?$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_3|Sure. You become the Dark Justice Avenger\nor whatever, and I take a dirt nap.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E怒,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_16|No, not that. I mean when we were talking\nabout making a heroic entrance.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_1|Yeah, what about it?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_10|Did you ever come up with anything\nyourself?$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_24|I'm going to charge headlong into the\nfray while shouting something awesome!$k$pLike, "Mine is the blade that shall\ncleave the dark in twain!"$k$pOr...you know. Something.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvjSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_18|$SveSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_8|Nice! I'm thinking now I'll do the same!\nBut maybe say something like...$k$p"I am peaceful by nature, but all who\nthreaten my friends will know pain!"$k$pYou know. Just to keep with the whole\nAvenging Avenger angle.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_4|Wait, hold on. You'd do the same thing?\nYou'd charge headlong into the fray?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_10|Well, the dialogue is a lot different,\nbut yeah.

What changed your mind?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_22|I've been thinking about this a lot since\nyou brought it up, you know?$k$pI mean, why did we dream about\nbecoming heroes in the first place?$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_8|Probably because we heard all\nthe stories about our parents.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_7|Right! And now that I'm here, I have\na chance to keep them safe.$k$pI can't do that if I hang back and wait,\nso I'm going to follow your lead.$k$p...Heh. It was still fun coming up\nwith that story, though.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_2|I know. It reminded me of when\nwe were kids. I miss those days.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E怒,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_13|Yeah, me too...$k$pSay, Cynthia? You know, maybe we could...\nUm, if you wanted...

I never\nthought about it quite like that.$k$pIt wouldn't be boring, that's for sure.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_8|So is that a yes?$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_17|...Yeah!
