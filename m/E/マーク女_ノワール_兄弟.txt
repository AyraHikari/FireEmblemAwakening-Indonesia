Sorry about that.$k$pBut that's just another reason why I'm\nworking hard to get my memories back.$k$pOnce I do, nobody will have to feel\nweird or awkward around me again.$k$p$E通常,|Pretty noble, huh? I'm such a sweet,\nselfless girl!$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_16|Heh, and so humble as well...$k$p$E通常,|In any case, I'm happy to help you get\nthose memories back however I can.$k$p$E笑,|Someday soon I bet we'll be able to laugh\nabout all the old times―now included!$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Heh, right!$k\n$Sbs1000|

Is there something\nin particular you need?$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_6|I might pick up a couple\nof things, yes.$k$pBut mostly I think there's\nsomething YOU need.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_5|It doesn't have to do with getting\nmy memories back, does it?$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_8|The opposite, really.$k$pMaybe there's no need to\nworry about your memories.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_7|That...makes no sense.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_7|I'll be honest―it does hurt to know\nyou've forgotten me.$k$pBut...maybe it's better to build new\nmemories than to worry about old ones.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_10|What do you mean?$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_9|I've been thinking about this a lot. Why you\nmight have lost your memories, I mean.$k$pAnd I'm wondering if you didn't have some\nawful memory you couldn't bear to keep.$k$p$E苦,汗|...I know I've got a few.$k$pI see a lot of faces, you know?\nPeople we couldn't save...$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|......$k$p$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_27|I'm sorry you have to bear those\ndreadful memories, Noire...$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E怒,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_3|Look, this is just a theory, and even if it's\ntrue, it's not like you did it consciously.$k$pBut I do think that getting your memories\nback might not necessarily be a good thing.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_17|$E笑,|Hmm... I understand, and believe me,\nI appreciate the thought...$k$p$E通常,|But I want to remember things, no matter\nhow painful they are.$k$p$E怒,|Because I'm sure there'll be plenty of great\nmemories mixed with the bad ones.$k$pAnd the truth, whatever it is... I really\nwant to have that back, you know?$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_26|Well, if you're sure,\nthen I'm happy to help.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_11|That's really kind of you, Noire, but do\nyou truly realize what you're saying?$k$pI mean, it could be years before I\nremember anything.

Really!\nP-please, let me make it up to you!$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_36|...V-very well. You can start by\ncoming with me into town.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_5|Huh? But you said that doesn't have\nto do with getting my memories back.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_6|Hey, there's no rule that says you can't\nhave a little fun while you try.$k$pAnd there's certainly no rule against making\nsome happy new memories, either.$k$p$E笑,|You're young! Live a little! There'll be\nplenty of time to worry later.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Right... You're right!\nThanks, Sis!$k\n$Sbs1000|
