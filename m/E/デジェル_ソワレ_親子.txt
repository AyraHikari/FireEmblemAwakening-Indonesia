That's enough for today.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_7|Yes, ma'am!$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_9|You're good, kid. Good enough to\nkeep me on my toes.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_6|I learned from my mother.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_7|What, you mean me?\nEr, I mean, future me?$k$pDammit! I can't wrap my head around\nall this time-travel business!$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_1|You fight just like the mother I knew.\n...Which makes sense, I suppose.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_18|That explains why you're so hard to beat.\nYou know all my moves.$k$pAlthough, wait. There's one thing\nI don't understand...$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|What's that?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_11|You're not great on horseback, are you?\nHow'd that happen?$k$pI'd think I would've taught you better.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_10|But you never taught me to ride.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_2|What? Why not? Did you guys have to\neat all the horses or something?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_9|We had horses. What we lacked was talent.\nOr more specifically, I lacked it.$k$pYou said I was a lost cause, so I wound up\nteaching myself. ...Poorly.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_8|Huh.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_12|So yeah, come to think of it,\nnow's your chance.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_2|Oh? My chance for what?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_16|To teach me how to ride! I mean, it\nIS your fault I don't already know.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_13|MY fault? How is it MY fault? I haven't done\nanything! I haven't even HAD you yet!$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_1|But you will! So come on,\nwhat do you say? Please?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_12|...Oh, fine. If you're so damn intent on\nlearning, we'll work it into the regimen.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_20|Perfect! Thanks, Mother.$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_デジェル_ソワレ_親子_Ｂ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_HEIWA1_2|50|$t1$Wmソワレ|7$Wmデジェル|3$w0|$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_5|All right. That's it for today's training.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_7|Yes, ma'am! Thank you, ma'am!$k$pSo? Am I any better on horseback?\nMaybe just a little?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_12|...What do you think?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_13|Not...really? Maybe I really\ndon't have the talent for it.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_10|Talent is an excuse!\nYou lack practice, not talent.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_9|No... You're right. I'm sorry.\nI guess I just got frustrated.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_9|Still, there IS something strange here...$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|How your own daughter could\nbe such a poor rider?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_11|No, not that.$k$pThe fact that future me told you anything\ndifferent than what I just told you myself.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_5|That it's a matter of practice, not talent?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_7|Yeah. I hate that word, "talent." Always\nhave. So why would I ever say you lacked it?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_13|Well, to be fair, you never used\nthe word "talent"...$k$pI believe your exact words were\n"you're not suited for riding."$k$pBut it's basically the same thing.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_2|Hmm... Well I'm sure I wouldn't say it\nwithout some reason...$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|Uh-oh. Does that mean you're going\nto stop teaching me again?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_31|I'm no damn quitter! We'll finish what\nwe started or die trying.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_20|Whew! Thanks!$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_9|Still, there's something funny about\nall of this...$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_デジェル_ソワレ_親子_Ａ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_YASASHISA1|0|$t1$Wmソワレ|7$Wmデジェル|3$w0|$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_6|You have a minute, Kjelle?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_7|Did you need me, Mother?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_7|Well, I think I figured out why I didn't\nteach you how to ride in the future.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_2|Oh no! Does this mean you're going\nto stop giving me lessons?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_10|Just listen: it takes a special talent to\nnavigate a mount around a battlefield.$k$pBut it's not the be-all, end-all of combat.\nEveryone has their own unique skill set.$k$pI think I probably wanted you to find\nyour own way to fight.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|But why? Riding is a crucial skill.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_18|Because I'm your mother.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$WaWhat?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_7|One tiny slipup can cost a warrior\nher life out in the field.$k$pAnd if I saw a risk, no matter how small,\nI'd want to nip it in the bud.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_5|But...you're teaching me now.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_2|Well, uh... Look, maybe it took a little bit\nfor the whole maternal thing to sink in.$k$pI agreed to teach you without really\nthinking about it.$k$pI acted like I was training a peer more than\nraising my daughter. ...Make sense?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_1|So your thinking has changed?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_7|Damn right it has! Spending all this time\ntogether, I feel a lot more...motherly.$k$pI think that's why I can see where\nfuture me was coming from.$k$pI would've been older than you, and worried\nabout what you'd do when I was gone.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_20|So you discouraged my riding since you\nwouldn't always be there to protect me?$k$p...Huh. In other words, you did what you\ndid because you cared about me.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_12|It's just a guess. I mean, I can't very well\ngo ask future me about it, right?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_8|I suppose that means the end of my lessons.\n*sigh* It was fun while it lasted.$k$pI still think I'd be more effective on\nhorseback, but I guess it's not meant to be.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_2|Now just a damn minute―who said\nanything about giving up?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|What? But you just...$k$pAren't you saying you agree with why\nyou stopped teaching me?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_30|Yeah, maybe, if I was future me!\nBut I'm NOW ME!$k$pWe're practically the same age here!$k$pWe can fight side by side for the\nrest of our lives, girly.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_5|Then you'll keep training me?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_7|Course I will! I'm sure I'd understand...\nEr, will understand... Er, whatever!$k$pAnd given we're both so young and fit,\nthere's no excuse not to train hard!$k$pHope you're ready to sweat...$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,汗|...J-just try to be a LITTLE gentle,\nwould you?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_24|I CAN'T HEAR YOU! LET'S GO,\nLET'S GO! MOVE IT!$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_13|Y-yes, ma'am!$k\n$Sbs1000|
