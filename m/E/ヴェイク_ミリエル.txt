HIYUUUP!\nGWAAAAAAR!$k\n$Wmミリエル|7$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Would you be so kind as to put an end\nto your caterwauling?$k$pI'm trying to read, but I can't hear myself\nthink over your incessant grunting.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_6|Har har! You gotta give it your all when\nya train, or it's just a waste of time.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_4|...Hmm. Yes, I suppose that makes sense.$k$pThe explosive release of air from the lungs\ngenerates power in peripheral muscles.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_7|Who's got periwinkle mussels now?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|And rapid spin attacks create centripetal\nforce that increases overall speed.$k$pFascinating! I imagine you used complex\ncalculus to optimize your methods?$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_11|Lady? From what you just said I understood\n"fascinating," and that's about it...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Surely you developed these skills of yours\nby calculating the forces involved?$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E通常,|$SvjSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_13|$SveSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_12|I don't need a buncha math mumbo\njumbo. I do it all by instinct!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Irrational means have yet taken you to a\nrational technique... Fascinating.$k$p$E通常,|Perhaps this "instinct" of which you\nspeak bears further investigation.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_17|Fightin' a war ain't rational, lady.\nJust watch me in the next battle.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|Very well. I shall do just that.$k\n$Sbs1000|

So did you\nwatch me fight or what?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Indeed. I observed that your battle shouts\nenhanced the effectiveness of your blows.$k$pOften the foe would briefly let down his\nguard, granting you a momentary opening.$k$pI had not realized the impact war cries\ncould have on the psychology of an enemy.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_11|Yeah, yeah. But what about me?\nWhat about the Vaike?!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|I observed the details of your moves,\nbut not from the perspective of the foe.$k$pPerhaps an analogy would be helpful here...$k$p$E通常,|So if we were to assume that you are\na planet, and the enemy is the sun―$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_7|Hey, wait. I wanna be the sun!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|But the sun does not travel around planets.\nRather, planets spin around the sun.$k$pOr so it was postulated in my mother's\nbook. It has yet to be proven...$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_12|You sure it's not your head spinnin'?\nI don't see this ground going anyplace.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_4|Alas, we cannot sense this motion,\nmaking the theory intuitively difficult.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_3|All right, sure. The ground's spinnin'.\nJust like when I swing my weapon, yeah?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Yes. This generates the centripetal force\nwe discussed the other day.$k$p$Eキメ,|I'm glad we had this conversation. It has\nhelped clarify my thoughts on the subject.$k$pWould you mind terribly if we continued our\ndiscussions? For research purposes?$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_19|You mean chat as friends? Er, well, sure.\nAfter all, we have so much in...uh, common?$k\n$Sbs1000|

You must have egghead pals\nwho are into this century-petal-force stuff.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvjSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|$SveSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_6|Yes, but you possess in abundance\nsomething that I do not―instinct.$k$pI learn a great deal from our conversations.\nThey are most rewarding.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_5|Well, I suppose I like talkin' to you, too.\nNot that I understand half of whatcha say...$k$p$E通常,|Speakin' of which, what's that giant brain\nof yours thinkin' about today?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Bonds.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_7|...Bonds?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|There is nothing so complex and deserving\nof study as the human heart.$k$pAnd additionally, the bonds of friendship\nthat arise unbidden between acquaintances.$k$pWhence do these bonds of friendship\noccur? How do they change us? Mold us?$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_6|Are ya askin' me? 'Cause I'd say stuff\nlike that just...happens.$k$pIt's like...when you fight alongside someone,\nyou start to trust 'em and like 'em better.$k$pTake us, for example. You and I are startin'\nto like each other more. Right?$k$pI think of you as a friend, and you think of\nme the same way. ...Er, right?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|I certainly find you an interesting\nsubject for observation.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_14|Er, yeah... That's not really what I meant.$k$p*Sigh* For someone so smart, you sure\ncan be pretty slow sometimes...$k$p$E通常,|Okay, how about this: Why don't\nyou and I go out together?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Go out? Where?\nAnd to what end?$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_3|We could walk around town, maybe drop by\nthe alehouse for a pint and some chat?$k$p$E笑,|It's how folks strengthen their bonds.\nThat's what you're interested in, right?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|I fail to see how meandering about town\nwill impact our relationship.$k$p$E笑,|But I am ever willing to experiment. Perhaps\nyour instincts will teach me something new.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_11|So...that's a yes, right?\nYou'll go with me?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|Yes, by all means―take me to\nthis alehouse of yours.$k\n$Sbs1000|

My friend!\nHello, friend.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_3|Er, you don't have to call me "friend" all\nthe time.

I must confess, informality\ndoes not come...naturally to me.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_11|Aw, Miriel. Is that a blush?! Don't tell me\nyou're gettin' shy on me now!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Shy? Of course not. I have never―\nThat is to say...I... Perhaps.

Ever since we visited\nthe alehouse, I haven't eaten well.$k$pI assumed the fault lied with the buzzard-\nand-kidney pie, but...it's something else.$k$pWhen I think of you, I feel a...tightness.\nHere, in my chest. Is this friendship?$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_14|Um... Actually, what you're feelin' is\na lot more serious than friendship.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_15|Blast! It IS a malady. I knew it!\nIs it fatal?

If I'm bein' honest here,\nI have feelings for you, too. Real feelings...$k$pSo yeah, I'm on board for your research,\nbut not just that...$k$pI want to make you my wife!\nLet's get hitched!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|Do you speak of a connubial relationship?\nA blessed sacrament? Marriage?$k$pWell, yes. I suppose that would be an\nenthralling, zesty experience.$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_20|...You know what?

Is it a talisman that\nevokes the bonds of love?$k$pOr merely a symbol of the husband's right\nto his wife's person and property?$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_25|...It's just a bloomin' ring!$k$pIt means I promise to be your husband\nand honor you and blah blah blah.$k$pIt just makes it all official-like.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Wouldn't a sealed and witnessed\ncontract be more appropriate?$k\n$Wsヴェイク|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_WYCK_EVT_14|Hah! It's just what you do, all right?\nIf ya get married, you gotta have a ring!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_17|...Fascinating.$k\n$Sbs1000|
