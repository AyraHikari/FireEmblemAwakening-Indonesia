MID_X019_OP1: $t1$Wmルキナ|7$Wmクロム|3$w0|$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_49|$E苦,汗|...Risen. And lots of them.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_31|$E怒,|Be careful. I feel a dark power emanating\nfrom them. Darker than usual.$k$p$E苦,汗|They resemble the monsters that drove us\nto the brink of extinction in my future...$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_38|$E怒,|I feel it, too. They seem stronger\nthan any we've faced before.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_34|$E怒,|Perhaps we needn't fight this battle.$k$pWe're miles from the nearest village...\nThese Risen may never threaten anyone.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_10|$E怒,|They aren't the only power at work here.\nThere's something else...$k$pSomething strong.$k
MID_X019_OP2: $t1$Wmヴァルハルト|3$w0|$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_1|Useless husks! Do you bend the knee\nto me already? Pah!$k$pI've no use for blind obedience.\nI need you to face me!$k$pI was driven off the path to conquest,\nand only blood will see me returned to it.$k$pOnly HIS blood!$k
MID_X019_ED1: $t1$Wmクロム|3$Wmヴァルハルト|7$w0|$Wsクロム|$Wa$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa......$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_38|$E怒,|You gave your word, Walhart.\nNow fight with us.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_4|First I must know how you defeated me.\nI have never lacked for strength.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_10|$E通常,|No, you're far stronger than me.\nEven now I think that's true.$k$p...But you stand alone.$k$p$E怒,|My own strength is but a fraction of\nthe strength I wield.$k$pMy allies hone and temper me. They boost\nmy morale and guide my actions.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_15|You tread the path of kings.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_3|$E通常,|What?$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_7|You rule by winning hearts.\n...I rule by winning battles.$k$pWe are opposites, you and I.$k$pI cannot change. I tread the path of the\nconqueror, and conquerors walk alone.$k$pHowever, I am curious to see just how\nfar your kingly path can lead you...$k
MID_X019_ED2: $t1$Wmクロム|3$Wmフレデリク|7$w0|$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_8|The wounded have been treated and the\nhorses loaded.

Just thinking out loud.$k$pYou know, honestly I'm a bit jealous\nof Walhart.$k$p$E怒,|He stands for strength above all things.\nHe has no regrets, no doubts.$k$pHe's a juggernaut that charges forward and\nmows down whatever gets in his way.$k$p$E苦,汗|I'm...not like that. My steps are often\nplagued with question and worry.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_25|$E怒,|Perhaps such emotions are part and parcel\nof your path, milord. Not obstacles to it.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_2|$E通常,|How do you mean?$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_15|The doubtless man's path is straight,\nbut not always true.$k$pA juggernaut does not pause to correct\ntrajectory. It merely presses on.$k$pBut by stopping, doubting, and occasionally\ndoubling back, you keep a truer course.$k$p$E通常,|I could not serve a conqueror, milord.\nAnd I pray you not think prudence a flaw.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_34|...Thank you, Frederick.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_17|$E笑,|Not at all, milord.\nShall we, then?$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_7|$E笑,|Of course.
