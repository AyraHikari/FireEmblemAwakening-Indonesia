You sound just like\nyer ma, Laurent!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvjSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_9|$SveSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|Naturally. She IS my mother.$k\n$Wsドニ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DENIS_EVT_2|Well, sure, but still...$k$pYou two're so alike, I sometimes wonder\nif ya inherited anythin' from me!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|Don't be absurd, Father.\nOf course I did.$k\n$Wsドニ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DENIS_EVT_8|Like what?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Like...the color of my hair.$k\n$Wsドニ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DENIS_EVT_16|Er, well, that's true, but I reckon that\nain't quite what I had in mind.$k$pAnythin' more meanin'ful? Maybe ya like\nto put pots on yer head and the like?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|Hmm, no. My bearing in that respect\nis profoundly normal.$k$pVery much to my relief, if I might be\nperfectly frank.$k\n$Wsドニ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DENIS_EVT_13|See, that's what I mean. Yer always\nso serious and uptight.$k$pYou could stand to loosen up a bit,\nmaybe act a bit more yer age.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_27|We're at war, Father. Acting like a child\nis hardly behavior to be encouraged.$k$pBesides, I'm a grown man. Older than\nLucina at this point, I suspect.$k\n$Wsドニ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DENIS_EVT_3|Wait, how could ya be older'n\nLucina?$k$pShe's already been born here, but yer\nma and I still ain't birthed you.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_15|I...I fear I've no more time to chat today.\nNow, if you'll excuse me.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wd$w0|$Wsドニ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DENIS_EVT_10|Laurent, wait!$k$p...Now what in tarnation\nwas all that about?$k\n$Sbs1000|

There's that much of a spread\nbetween when you two landed?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|...Indeed.$k$pHence, I have aged three years more than\nshe in the course of reaching this moment.$k$pSomewhere along the way, I passed her\nin terms of physical age.$k\n$Wsドニ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DENIS_EVT_12|So ya been 'round these parts\nfor five years all by yerself...?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Yes. So as you see, I'm far too old to be\nindulging in childish behaviors.$k$pI trust that explanation has cleared up\nyour confusion? Now, if you'll excuse me...$k\n$Wsドニ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DENIS_EVT_13|Laurent, wait! Why haven't ya ever\nmentioned any of this 'fore?$k$pYou were cut off from everyone else for five\nyears. Musta been lonely somethin' fierce...$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|As I've said time and again,\nI am a grown man.$k$p...I managed fine on my own.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wd$w0|$w500|$Wsドニ|$WaLaurent...$k\n$Sbs1000|

No one to lend an\near to my despair. It was...awful.$k$pMany nights, I thought I'd die alone.\nThat the pain would kill me, or...$k\n$Wsドニ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DENIS_EVT_9|I'm awful sorry I didn't find ya earlier,\nLaurent. Please forgive me.$k$pJust know that I ain't never gonna leave ya\nagain! Cross m'heart and hope to spit!$k\n$Sbs1000|
