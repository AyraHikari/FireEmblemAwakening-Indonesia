I'm ready to hear\nthe story now.$k\n$Wsチキ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIKI_EVT_16|$E苦,|Oh, yes. I did promise, didn't I?$k$p*Yawn* But I'm feeling very tired at\nthe moment.

I suppose they are.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_7|Why is that?$k\n$Wsチキ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIKI_EVT_10|It's because I am pure blooded.$k$pManakete blood runs thick in my veins,\nand makes me look more...dragon-like.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_8|Is that also why your fangs and\nclaws are sharper than mine?$k\n$Wsチキ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIKI_EVT_11|That is a matter only of age. I have lived\nmany, many more centuries than you.$k$pAs dragons get older and become more\npowerful, our claws and fangs sharpen.$k$pIt will be the same for you when you reach\nmy age, though it will take millennia.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_11|That'll be sweet...$k$p$E通常,|I see... So, why is your skin so much\nthicker and harder than mine?$k\n$Wsチキ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIKI_EVT_5|That comes from fighting in\ncountless battles.$k$pThe more times a dragon is struck by blows,\nthe thicker and harder our hide becomes.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_25|I see. That's useful!\n...Thanks for explaining everything, Tiki.$k\n$Wsチキ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIKI_EVT_2|Not at all.$k$pEr, but would you mind leaving me now?\nI'm starting to feel drowsy.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_4|Oh, of course.

Remember when I said\nI had to tell you something difficult?$k$pWe manaketes are destined to suffer\nbecause of our love for humankind.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_10|Destined to...suffer?$k\n$Wsチキ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIKI_EVT_4|We live for millennia, while humans\nflicker out like candles.$k$pThe greatest friendship I ever knew\nlasted just a few short decades...$k$pAnd when King Marth died, I was left\nto wander the centuries alone.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_2|...I see. I have to be prepared to\nlose everyone I love.$k\n$Wsチキ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIKI_EVT_5|The dragon blood in your veins\ncurses you to such a fate.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_3|...Wow.
