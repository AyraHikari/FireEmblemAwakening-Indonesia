I'm headed into town.\nWant to come along?$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|I'd love to! Is there something\nin particular you need?$k\n$Wsアズール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_AZUR_EVT_4|I might pick up a couple\nof things, yeah.$k$p$E笑,|But mostly I think there's\nsomething YOU need.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_5|It doesn't have to do with getting\nmy memories back, does it?$k\n$Wsアズール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_AZUR_EVT_1|$E通常,|The opposite, really.$k$pMaybe there's no need to\nworry about your memories.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_7|That...makes no sense.$k\n$Wsアズール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_AZUR_EVT_3|$E笑,|I'll be honest―it does hurt to know\nyou've forgotten me.$k$p$Eキメ,|But...maybe it's better to build new\nmemories than to worry about old ones.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_10|What do you mean?$k\n$Wsアズール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_AZUR_EVT_19|I've been thinking about this a lot. Why you\nmight have lost your memories, I mean.$k$pAnd I'm wondering if you didn't have some\nawful memory you couldn't bear to keep.$k$p$E苦,汗|...I know I've got a few.$k$pI see a lot of faces, you know?\nPeople we couldn't save...$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|......$k$p$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_27|I'm sorry you have to bear those\ndreadful memories, Inigo...$k\n$Wsアズール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_AZUR_EVT_12|Look, this is just a theory, and even if it's\ntrue, it's not like you did it consciously.$k$pBut I do think that getting your memories\nback might not necessarily be a good thing.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_17|$E笑,|Hmm... I understand, and believe me,\nI appreciate the thought...$k$p$E通常,|But I want to remember things, no matter\nhow painful they are.$k$p$E怒,|Because I'm sure there'll be plenty of great\nmemories mixed with the bad ones.$k$pAnd the truth, whatever it is... I really\nwant to have that back, you know?$k\n$Wsアズール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_AZUR_EVT_18|$Eキメ,|Well, if you're sure,\nthen I'm happy to help.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_11|That's really kind of you, Inigo, but do\nyou truly realize what you're saying?$k$pI mean, it could be years before I\nremember anything. Or decades.$k$pHeck, there's a decent chance I may\nnever get my memories back at all.$k$pI don't want to drag you into something\nthat could last forever.$k\n$Wsアズール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_AZUR_EVT_23|I'm already stuck with you forever,\nyou goof. I'm your brother!$k$p$E通常,|We're family―memories or no.\nYou couldn't keep me away.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_31|Inigo, I... *sniff* Thank you!$k$p$E笑,|I'll do everything I can!$k\n$Wsアズール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_AZUR_EVT_24|$E笑,|Then start by coming with me into town.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_5|Huh? But you said that doesn't have\nto do with getting my memories back.$k\n$Wsアズール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_AZUR_EVT_2|$Eキメ,|Hey, there's no rule that says you can't\nhave a little fun while you try.$k$pAnd there's certainly no rule against making\nsome happy new memories, either.$k$p$E通常,|You're young! Live a little! There'll be\nplenty of time to worry later.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Right... You're right!\nThanks, Brother!$k\n$Sbs1000|
