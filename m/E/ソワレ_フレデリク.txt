That's what's wrong!$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_6|Good heavens. That was days ago...$k$pIs there really any need to compete?\nWe fight for the same cause.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_11|Yeah, but it... I don't know. It was as if\nI KNEW you were going to beat me.$k$pI've never had that feeling with\nanyone else. ...Never.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_7|When you first joined the Shepherds,\nI was the one who taught you.$k$pPerhaps that has something to do with it.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_12|Ha! I remember... I came in thinking\nI could mop the floor with all of you.$k$pAnd I might have until you showed up!$k$pYou didn't look like much back then,\nbut you beat the crap out of me.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_11|I wouldn't say I beat the... *ahem* Yes, well.\nI suppose it was a rite of passage of sorts.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_5|I didn't sleep for days after that...\nI was just so damn angry.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_9|Perhaps this is the cause of your\ncurrent consternation.$k$pWhen master and student first fight,\nthe student naturally stands no chance.$k$pThe perception that one's teacher is\nunbeatable can be difficult to shake.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_2|So I can't beat you now because you beat\nthe crap out of me when I was 15?$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_12|It doesn't sound quite so honorable\nwhen you say it in that manner...$k\n$Sbs1000|
