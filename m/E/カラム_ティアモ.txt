Don't worry about it.\nIt's my fault I got caught.$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_6|Practicing your stealth moves, eh?\nAre you planning some sort of covert op?$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_6|A good warrior should never neglect the\nchance to practice ALL her skills.$k$pYou never know when they might\ncome in handy.$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_18|Wow, Cordelia. You're so dedicated.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_11|Yes, but when it comes to stealth,\nyou have us all beat.$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_12|Yes, but I don't know if that counts.\nIt's not like I practice or anything.$k$pPeople just seem to...overlook me.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_17|Oh, come now. There must be\nSOMETHING special that you do!$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_9|Not really.

Are you practicing\nyour stealth moves again?$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_14|Kellam, there you are! Listen, I think\nI've got the hang of this now.$k$pI just circled the whole camp\nwithout being spotted by anyone!$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_8|Really? Oh, well done!\nThat must have been hard.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_8|$E笑,|But here's the thing: I made a count\nof everyone, and I never found you.$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_9|That's because I was on guard duty\npatrolling the camp's perimeter.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_12|What?! B-but I was sneaking AROUND the\nperimeter! I didn't see you anywhere!$k$pAre you sure you weren't taking a nap\nin one of the tents? I won't tell.$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_16|No, I was on the perimeter. I even saw\nwhen you hid behind that raspberry bush.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_1|Wait. You SAW me circling the camp?\nThen I didn't... Then I wasn't...$k$pOh, blast it all!$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_11|Aw, don't be glum. It's hard to be stealthy\nwhen you stand out as much as you do.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_5|You think I stand out?$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_7|Well, I mean, you're just so pretty,\nand you have that long hair, and―$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_15|That's it. I'm getting a haircut.$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_9|Oh, no! Please don't do that!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_16|I'm just joking, Kellam.

Just let me think...\nOh, I know!$k$pYou're better at being able to do\nmore things than anyone else!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_9|That's...not quite what I had in mind.$k\n$Wsカラム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_KARM_EVT_8|But it's an amazing skill! You learn new\nthings nearly every day, right?$k$pThat means you're the best at\nbeing average at everything!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_19|Um...okay? I suppose that IS\nsomething to be proud of, huh?$k\n$Sbs1000|
