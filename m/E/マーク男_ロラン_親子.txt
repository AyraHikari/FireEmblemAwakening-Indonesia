I wonder why I have no memory\nof my father...$k$pAll my memories of Mother are so\ncrisp and clear...$k$pI remember what an amazing tactician she\nwas, all the time we studied together...$k$pBut nothing at all about my father.\nIt's one big blank.$k\n$Wmロラン|3$w0|$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_12|Morgan? What are you doing?$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_1|Father! That's amazing!\nI was just thinking about you!$k$pIs this fate?! This is totally fate!\nFamily-style fate!$k$p$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_24|...Wait, no. How did Mother put it?$k$p"We're not pawns of some scripted fate.\nIt's the invisible ties we forge that bind us."$k$p$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_11|So yeah, it's not fate. It's the\nwhole invisible bond-link...thing!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|That is a most unscientific analysis.\nAnd yet, oddly plausible...$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_3|Yup! Even without my memories, there's\nan invisible thread that links us.$k$pEr, but that reminds me...$k$p$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_23|I was just wondering how I could have\npossibly forgotten you, Father.$k$pDo you think maybe you could help\nme get those memories back?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|I would be delighted to try. After all―$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_25|Yay! Thanks so much! I'll start preparing.\nOh, I can't wait to get started!$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wd$w0|$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_7|The loquaciousness of that boy\nis unparalleled...$k\n$Sbs1000|

Do you have a moment?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Yes, of course.$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_25|Perfect! Then let's get started on\nProject Get Memories of Dad Back!$k$pStep one―figure how we're going\nto trigger some flashbacks.$k$p$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_22|I've already tried banging my head against\na post, but nothing.$k$pI mean, it made me dizzy and nauseated,\nbut it didn't unearth any hidden memories.$k$pWhat do you think, Father?\nPerhaps a stone wall would work better?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|I see no point in further damaging your\nalready fragile cranium.$k$pPerhaps you could try staring at me for\na while? It might help trigger a memory.$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_4|Argh, that's perfect! You're a genius!$k$pI must have seen your face a million times\nin the future.$k$pIt's bound to bring SOMETHING back\nif I stare at it long enough.$k$p$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_11|Okay, sorry to invade your personal space\nhere, but... Here goes...$k$p......$k$p.........$k$p............$k$p...............$k$p$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_15|Drats! It's not working.\nI don't remember a thing.$k$pIt's like... Have you ever stared at a\nword so long it kind of fell apart?$k$p$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_16|And you think, "Is that how that's spelled?\nWait, is that even a real WORD?!"$k$pExcept here it's "Is that what Father\nlooked like?"$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_6|Oh, dear. It would seem this experiment\nis also a failure...$k$pLet's take a break from the memory\nproject for today, shall we?$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_14|Sure... I'm still a little dizzy from banging\nthe post earlier, to be honest...$k$p$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_25|But this doesn't end here! I'm not giving\nup until I remember you, Father!$k\n$Sbs1000|
