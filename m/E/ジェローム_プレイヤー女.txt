Hmm...$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_4|Why are you so obsessed\nwith what I do, anyway?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_5|Oh, I wouldn't say obsessed.\nMaybe...concerned.$k$pI just think you could do a better job of\ngetting to know your comrades-in-arms.$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_7|Why?
