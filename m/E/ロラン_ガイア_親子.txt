You sound just like\nyour mother, Laurent.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvjSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_9|$SveSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|Naturally. She IS my mother.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_12|Well, yeah, but still...$k$pYou two are so alike, I sometimes wonder\nif you inherited anything from me.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|Don't be absurd, Father.\nOf course I did.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_11|Oh? Like what?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Like...the color of my hair.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_9|Er, well, yeah, but that's not exactly\nwhat I was talking about.$k$pAnything more substantive? An undying\naffinity for sweets, perhaps?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|Hmm, no. My bearing in that respect\nis profoundly normal.$k$pVery much to my relief, if I might be\nperfectly frank.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_13|See, that's what I mean. You're always\nso serious and uptight...$k$pYou could stand to loosen up a bit.\nMaybe act a bit more your age.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_27|We're at war, Father. Acting like a child\nis hardly behavior to be encouraged.$k$pBesides, I'm a grown man. Older than\nLucina at this point, I suspect.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_4|Wait, how could you be older than\nLucina?$k$pShe's already been born here, but your\nmother and I still haven't had you.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_15|I...I fear I've no more time to chat today.\nNow, if you'll excuse me.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wd$w0|$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_1|Laurent, wait!$k$p...The heck was that about?$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ロラン_ガイア_親子_Ｂ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_SERIOUS2|0|$t1$Wmガイア|3$Wmロラン|7$w0|$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_2|Hello, Laurent.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_12|Father. How may I help you?$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_5|I was thinking about how you said\nyou were older than Lucina...$k$pCan you explain that?\nI'm a little lost.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_7|It's fairly straightforward. Travel among\neras is imprecise. There are...variables.$k$pLucina arrived at the onset of the war with\nPlegia some two years ago.$k$pI, on the other hand, have been here for\nnearly five years.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_6|There's that much of a spread between\nwhere you landed? Er, when you landed?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|...Indeed.$k$pHence, I have aged three years more than\nshe in the course of reaching this moment.$k$pSomewhere along the way, I passed her\nin terms of physical age.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_14|You've been in this era for\nfive years all by yourself?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Yes. So as you see, I'm far too old to be\nindulging in childish behaviors.$k$pI trust that explanation has cleared up\nyour confusion? Now, if you'll excuse me...$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_13|Laurent, wait! Why haven't you ever\nmentioned any of this before?$k$pCut off from everyone for five whole\nyears. You must've been...lonely.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|As I've said time and again,\nI am a grown man.$k$p...I managed fine on my own.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wd$w0|$w500|$Wsガイア|$WaLaurent...$k\n$Sbs1000|

But today's different.\nBecause today...$k$pCoochy coochy coo!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_16|Gah! Ah ha! Ah ha ha ha! S-stop that!\nF-Father, have you gone mad?!$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_11|Ah-hah! So you CAN smile!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|I beg your pardon?!$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_5|You're always so bent on being such\na serious, proper adult.$k$pI worry that you put too much\npressure on yourself.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_7|For the last time, I am not a child!$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_3|Age has nothing to do with it.$k$pIt doesn't matter if you're older than\nLucina. Or heck, older than me!$k$pYou're still a child. You're MY child.\n...You're my son.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|Er, I...$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_10|And you're not alone anymore,\nso stop isolating yourself.$k$pYou've got friends, and you've got me.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_14|......$k$pYou're right. All that time, it was...\nI was so lonely.$k$pYear after year, all alone...\nWandering an era where I knew no one.$k$pHoping to meet up with the others but\nknowing how miniscule my chances were...$k$pI had no one to help me. No one to lend an\near to my despair. It was...awful.$k$pMany nights, I thought I'd die alone.\nThat the pain would kill me, or...$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_9|I'm sorry I didn't find you earlier,\nLaurent. Please forgive me.$k$pAnd know that I'll never leave\nyour side again...$k\n$Sbs1000|
