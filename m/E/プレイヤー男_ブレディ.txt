Everybody likes him...\nThey trust him as a tactician...$k$pHis orders are so darn precise...\nHe keeps his eye on the whole field...$k$pI know I wouldn't be scrappin' half as well\nif he wasn't telling me what to do.$k$pPlus the guy's a beast in combat,\nalways defending the rest of us...$k\n$Wmusername|7$w0|$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_5|Hmm?
