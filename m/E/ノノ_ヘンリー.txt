What cute little kids!$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_1|I've seen them around. They're from\none of the villages near the camp.$k$pBut what do you mean, "cute little\nkids"? Aren't you a kid, too?$k\n$Wsノノ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NONO_EVT_12|No! I'm an adult woman who's more than\na thousand years older than you!$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_7|Oh, right!

It's fun!\n...In fact, you should join us next time.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_6|Okay!$k\n$Wsノノ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NONO_EVT_19|Wait, really? Oh, that's so exciting!$k$pI've asked just about everyone in camp,\nbut they always turn me down.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_19|It's 'cause you're always so full of energy.\n"One more time, one more time, pleeease!"$k$pMost people just can't keep up with\nthat kind of raw enthusiasm!$k\n$Wsノノ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NONO_EVT_10|I know, right? It's so annoying how\nquickly some people tire out.$k$pI mean, ten hours? Come on!\nThat's like a warm-up!$k$pDo you know I haven't found a single\nplaymate since I joined this dumb army?$k$p$E笑,|...Until now, that is! Hee hee! We're going\nto play games from dawn to dusk!$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_9|I know how you feel!$k$pYa know, I don't tell many people this, but\nI was kind of abandoned when I was young.$k$pMy family ignored me completely,\nand I didn't have any playmates.$k$pBut it was fine, because I learned to amuse\nmyself! Oh, and make friends with animals.$k\n$Wsノノ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NONO_EVT_28|Then we're exactly the same!\nBut now we have each other, right?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_20|Nya ha ha! You know it!$k\n$Sbs1000|
