It's genetic or...something.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_9|What about the people who get hurt on\nthese little strolls of destruction?!$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_19|Oh, gosh, I would never do that! Never!$k$pI always go somewhere nice and quiet\nwhere there's no one around.$k$pThen I just sort of unleash myself on\ntrees and bushes and stuff.$k$pMy record is thirty giant firs in a\nsingle rampage! Pretty impressive, huh?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_21|Well, I...suppose that is impressive.\nBut are you sure it's safe?$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_7|Er, like I might hurt myself on a\nsharp branch or something?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|Something like that.$k$p$E通常,|...Listen, Nah. You think I could\nwatch the next time you do this?$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_1|Oh, sure. That would be no problem.\nIn fact, it'd make it more fun!$k\n$Wsンン|$Wd$w0|$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_9|Er, fun? Maybe this isn't such\na good idea after all...$k\n$Sbs1000|

Oh, n-no. Of course not.\nI'm sure it's quite safe...$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_23|Liar, liar, pantaloons aflame!$k$pJust remember, I only rampage if there's\nno one around. It's perfectly safe.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_16|I'm sure you're right. Who could you\nhurt in such an isolated spot?$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_9|Exactly! I'm not an idiot, you know.\nI've been doing this for a while.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|...Still, it makes me wonder why you\nhave such urges in the first place.$k$pI assumed it was something instinctual\nin your species...$k$pBut there's no record of your mother\never doing it.$k$pIn fact, I've never heard of any manakete\nengaging in such behavior!$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_6|Beats me. Hmm... The other manaketes\nhave always been true-bloods, right?$k$pAs far as I know, I'm the only half-\nhuman manakete that's ever lived.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_23|You think it's something from your\nhuman side that compels you?$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_12|Hey, I dunno.

Oh, gods, that was fun!\nThat was the best rampage EVER!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_16|Here, Nah. Have some water.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_25|Thanks!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_9|Gracious, you certainly took it up\nanother notch today.$k$pIt's a good thing we're in such\nan isolated spot here.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_4|Gods, yeah. Can you imagine me\nrunning amok in the middle of town?!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_11|A grim thought indeed.$k$pBut listen, I have a theory about\nwhy you need to rampage.$k$pI think they're a way for your dragon\nside to get some exercise.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_7|Hmm, yeah. Could be. Is exercise\nsomething you humans do a lot?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_20|Most of us, yes. It's a great way to get\nrid of stress and blow off steam.$k$pAnd the healers say regular exercise\nis the key to good health.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_10|Do you uproot trees?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|Er, no, not usually.\nIn fact, almost never.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_7|Oh. That's too bad. Uprooting trees is my\nfavorite bit.$k$pOh, so the other day in the village I saw a\nlady screaming at her husband.$k$pShe was chasing him around the square\nwith this huge rolling pin.$k$pThen she went in the house, threw his\nstuff out of the window, and stomped on it.$k$pWas that exercise? 'Cause it sure\nlooked like a good workout.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_13|Er, no. That's something different. Although\nI wager she was blowing off steam...$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_3|Hmm. Well, it seems that my exercise\nneeds to be destructive.$k$pI can't stop until I've splintered some\ntrees or torn up a swathe of undergrowth.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_11|It's a good thing we have\nplenty of forest to spare.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_9|Oh, and I feel much better running amok\nif you're here with me.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_5|Because I can make sure that you\ndon't destroy anything important?$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_5|Because forests are dark and scary\nand have lots of ghosts.$k$pBut when you're around, I'm not\nscared one little bit!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_17|Heh. Sometimes I forget there's a little\ngirl inside that monstrous beast.$k\n$Wsンン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_4|So you ARE going to keep coming out\nwith me for my exercises, aren't you?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_16|Of course. I've grown quite fond of them,\nand of you...$k$pYou're like the little sister I never had...and\nI guess the big monster I never had, too!\n$k$Wsンン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NN_EVT_25|YAAAAAAAAAY!$k\n$Sbs1000|
