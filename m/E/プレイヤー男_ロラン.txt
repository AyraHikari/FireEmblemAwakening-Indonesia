I'm particularly avid in my\nacquisition of magical tomes.$k$pAs you're well aware, they serve both as\na mage's weapon and a history.$k$pSome tell of the ages of the gods; others\nare treatises on nature and its energies.$k$pReading and analyzing their contents is\nan extremely satisfying pursuit.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_23|Combat know-how and abstract knowledge\nin one convenient package!$k$pI can certainly see the appeal.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_6|Just so. Though I am particularly drawn to\ntomes of a somewhat...peculiar nature.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_5|Peculiar how?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Some tomes offer precious little in practical\nuse, but hide wildly entertaining powers.$k$pAnd whenever I find a book of that sort,\nI simply must acquire it for my collection.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_11|Useless but entertaining powers, huh?$k$pSo...different from attack spells and\narcane curses and the like?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_9|Don't get me wrong―I am deeply\ninterested in tomes of that nature as well.$k$pBut the sort I speak of are cut from a\ndifferent cloth altogether.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_18|Can you give me an example?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|Hmm... I fear words could not do them\njustice.$k$pPerhaps you'll allow me to select a few\nfrom my shelf to show you in person?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|Absolutely! I look forward to it.$k\n$Sbs1000|

The entertaining ones!\nI've been eager to have a look.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Ha ha, excellent. Then let us begin!$k$p...This tome conjures forth a whirlwind.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_5|That's a sort of wind magic seen in battle,\nisn't it? I'd hardly name it useless.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_9|Not when the whirlwind in question can\nfit atop the palm of one's hand.$k$pI assure you, it's as lethal as a kitten.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_18|You're kidding, that small?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|Shall we have a demonstration?\n...Haah!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_18|Whoa! Look at the little guy go!\nIt really does fit in your hand!$k$p...Ah! It disappeared!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|It is as short-lived as it is diminutive!\nAnd with zero practical value.$k$pUnless you find yourself in need of\na light breeze on a warm day, that is.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_17|Ha ha! Adorable...$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Next, an incantation that summons\na faint magical light.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_5|That sounds like it would have plenty\nof practical applications as well.$k$pWhat's the catch?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_9|Very astute of you to ask.$k$p$Eキメ,|The spell is broken the moment the caster\nceases the incantation.$k$pTo make matters worse, the text dates all\nthe way back to the dawn of magic.$k$pIt's rife with words near impossible to say,\nand one mistake will leave you in the dark.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_23|Wow. Even magic was less\nconvenient back in the old days...$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|This beautiful thing is a tome\nof proximal telepathy.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_10|Telepathy? That sounds amazing!\nHow does it work?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_16|I shall demonstrate.\n...Huuup!$k$p$E苦,汗|(Well...? Can you hear my\nvoice within your head?)$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_18|Wha―?! Your lips aren't moving,\nbut I hear you in my mind!$k$pThat's incredible, Laurent!\nHow is THAT not useful?!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_7|$Wv...GAAAAAAAASP!$k$p$E通常,|...I fear the spell's effects last only as\nlong as the caster holds his breath.$k$pWhat's more, the range extends only\nslightly past arm's length.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_17|Ha ha! I see! Speaking normally seems\nlike the all-around winner, then.$k$pStill, hearing your voice echo inside my\nhead... What a fascinating experience.$k$pThank you for sharing all these\nwith me, Laurent.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_9|My pleasure. There are others as well,\neach as hollow a novelty as the next.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|But you were certainly right about\nthem being entertaining!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|I am glad you found them agreeable.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_34|Actually, I suppose providing a bit\nof fun IS a useful quality, isn't it?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|Hmm... Yes, I'm inclined to agree.$k$pIt is precisely because they are so\nuseless that they are so endearing.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_20|You say you have others like these, yes?\nWould you mind sharing them sometime?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|It would be my pleasure.$k\n$Sbs1000|

That's it?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|Yes, but it creates them from nothing!\nRainless rainbows!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_20|I suppose that's impressive, but...\nWell actually, I'm not sure.$k$pIf you wanted to see a rainbow, you could\njust wait for it to rain like normal, no?$k$pOr perhaps acquire a prism from any\nlocal apothecary.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_10|Ah, but you're forgetting our previous\nconversations, $Nu.$k$pSometimes the most useless of novelties\ncan serve a vital purpose―as entertainment.$k$pBringing calm and joy to a war-worn army\nsounds like powerful magic to me.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_11|Fair enough.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|Well, no time like the present.
