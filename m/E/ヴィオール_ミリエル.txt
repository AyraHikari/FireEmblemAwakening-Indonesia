I've prepared a full\nreport on our earlier experiment.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_6|...Experiment? Are you talking\nabout my fortune-telling?$k$pThe one where I told you to\nbeware of water?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Yes. And contrary to my initial hypothesis,\nyour prediction was most accurate.$k$pI was caught in a sudden cloudburst\nand became soaked to the skin.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_5|You don't say? That's amazing!\nFantastic! Ha ha!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|I beg your pardon?$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_8|Er, what I mean to say is...\nI trust you were all right?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|It was fortunate that I'd left my books\nback in my tent.$k$pThe squall's fury would have reduced\nthem to illegible wads of pulp.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_16|Ah, if only I was there to protect you\nfrom the tempest with my cloak!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|You have further piqued my interest\nin this esoterica.$k$pWill you not teach me even the\nbasics of your art?$k$pI cannot hope to study what I do not\ncomprehend on a base level.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_13|Ah, my sweet Miriel.

Please, tell me more.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_12|Let me think... How can I put it?\nIt's like an exercise in persuasion.$k$pI simply tell the person something\nthat is likely to happen, yes?$k$pAnd then I convince them it is an\nomen meant only for them!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|And you choose a vague, common event,\nsuch as any interaction with water.$k$pThat way, when it occurs, the person will\nestablish a link back to your augury.$k$pThey are so preoccupied with seeing their\nexperiences as special, they never notice.$k$pI see... So when you told my fortune, in a\nway you were merely appealing to my ego.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_8|People will believe the moon is made of\ncheese if you just turn their heads right.$k$pReally, that's all there is to it.\n...I hope you're not too disappointed?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Not at all.\nOn the contrary, in fact.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_6|Oh?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|Though my scientific mind had doubt,\na small part of me believed your claims.$k$pYou clearly have great insight into the\nhuman psyche.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_11|Er, well...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_27|This opens up a whole new field of very\npromising study.$k$pYou must teach me everything you know.\nVerbal tricks, persuasive skills, all of it.$k$pI will record your findings and study them\nat length later.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_4|A-all right.
