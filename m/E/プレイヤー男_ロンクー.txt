Sorry, Lon'qu. I just got\ncaught up watching you practice.$k$pYour style is a perfect blend of\naccuracy, power, and speed.$k$pThey really know what they're\ndoing up in Regna Ferox.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_4|Strength is everything there.\nWeakness is weeded out and eliminated.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_19|Would you mind teaching\nme a few moves?$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_11|...I am no teacher.$k$pBesides, you are of Ylisse. The knights\nof your people have their own style.$k$pYou would be better served learning\nfrom Frederick.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_20|Oh, I already am.$k$pBut with the two styles being so different,\nwhy not learn what both can offer?$k$pIt's possible a mix of the two would be\nstronger than either one alone.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_14|A naive thought.\n...But not impossible.$k$p$E笑,|Very well. Draw your sword.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_5|Wait, we're jumping right\ninto sparring?$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_4|I told you, I am no teacher. You will have to\nlearn for yourself.$k$pCome! Show me how a man of Ylisse fights!\nYou will not be the only one to learn here.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|So be it!$k\n$Sbs1000|

I'm still\nrecovering from the last one...$k$pI'll say this―I'm glad we're\nnot at war with Ferox!$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_15|And I'm far from her strongest.\nI am...inexperienced, yet. Raw.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_18|I find that hard to believe. You're a beast!$k$pBut I guess you got where you are now\nby being tough on yourself.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_11|No. Just truthful. If you saw what I\nhave seen...$k$pIf you saw him fight, you would\nknow how far I have to go.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_10|You mean Khan Basilio?$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_4|His command of his weapon lends it a\nweight. A...depth.$k$pI may as well be swinging a feather by\ncomparison.$k$pKnowing his power, I would not dare\ncall myself strong.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_23|But he's given you something\nto strive for.$k$p$E笑,|I'm envious, really.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_14|If you would grow stronger,\nfind a paragon of your own to pursue.$k$p$E笑,|Meanwhile, if you wish to spar,\nyou need only ask.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|I will, thanks.$k\n$Sbs1000|

I feared\nyou were neglecting your training, but...$k$pIs this mountain of books all treatises on\nwarcraft?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|Yes. I have to balance training my sword\narm with honing my tactician's eye.$k$pWe're a small force up against a big army.\nWe need to fight smart to survive.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_15|...You are a strange one.$k$pStrategist or soldier―most men make\ntheir choice and don't look back.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_20|Then I choose to be the first man to pick\nboth.$k$pI want to keep my friends safe. And the\ntownspeople and everyone else, too.$k$pSo when my sword won't reach,\nI'll protect them with my tactics.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_5|You once said you envied me because\nyou had no one to serve as your goal.$k$pPerhaps that's because you aim for\nheights no man has yet achieved.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_17|Is what I said really so revolutionary?$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_4|What you propose is a tremendous\nundertaking. ...But a worthy one.$k$pI suspect there is much I can\nlearn from you yet.$k\n$Sbs1000|
