There she is.\nAre you free, Lucina?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_18|Hello, Kjelle. What did you need?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_8|A sympathetic ear.$k$pI've been challenging everyone in camp to\nsparring matches. ...What a pathetic lot!$k$pNone of them can even land a blow\non me... It's a bit of a disappointment.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_25|Is that really a surprise? I suspect very few\nare a fair match for you in a duel.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_3|You flatter me.$k$pHmmm... I bet you would\noffer more of a challenge!$k$pHeh, in fact you'd likely wipe\nthe floor with my corpse!$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_21|I hardly think that's the case.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_23|Trust me, I can tell. You're strong.$k$pIn fact, I bet the two of us could win\nthis war all by ourselves.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_22|That's a bit excessive, isn't it?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_19|Big armies are inefficient. They take too\nlong to react, and they lack agility.$k$pSurely you've heard tales of the ancient\ndays, before the Hero-King Marth?$k$pThey say one of his ancestors fought\nback a great evil single-handedly!$k$pPerhaps we'd do well to take a lesson from\nhim―form an elite band of fighters.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_26|I'll grant you that small forces\ndo have their advantages.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_6|Big organizations mean\nbureaucracy and bloat.$k$pBesides, half of any larger army\nis just cannon fodder.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_24|I'll not think of any of our men as sacrificial\nlambs, and neither would Chrom, Kjelle.$k$pStill, it's true that uniting a large group\nof people under a single cause is difficult.$k$pMore so than I had imagined...$k$pAnd I agree it's important to hone one's\nabilities as an individual.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_20|Ha! I knew you'd understand!\nWe're a matched pair after all.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_17|I do feel, however, that your\nviews are too extreme.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|We'll crush them all! Slash them to bi―\nEr, sorry. Did you say something?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_13|...I rest my case.$k\n$Sbs1000|

I thought\nthe two of us might have lunch.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_21|I would enjoy dining with you, Kjelle,\nbut why just the two of us?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_6|Because it's no fun eating with a bunch\nof puny weaklings. Am I right?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_17|...Everyone in this camp is\nequally our ally, are they not?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|Sure, but some are more equal than others.\nEspecially when it comes to fighting!$k$p...What, you don't want to eat with me?\nIs that it?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_22|Please do not mistake my meaning.$k$pWe've known each other since we were\nchildren―I consider you a close friend.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_20|Thanks, Lucina! I feel the same.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_19|Then, as my friend, perhaps you'll indulge\nme by inviting the others to join us?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_5|*Sigh* Fine. Just don't be surprised when\nthey surrender to a bowl of pudding.$k$pShall we then?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_28|Yes. And thank you, Kjelle.$k\n$Sbs1000|

I promised my father I would\ndine with him this evening.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_14|Heh. Not much I can do if ol' Chrom wants\nto see you, huh? He's got me beat.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_21|Beat at what?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_8|Well, he's about the strongest man in this\narmy, isn't he?$k$pI don't see much of a chance of beating him\nin single combat, so I'll cede this round.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_22|...Just how do you imagine\nsocial affairs work?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_6|If someone's stronger than me,\nthey get my respect.$k$pAnd if they're weaker than me,\nI don't waste my time.$k$pThat's all I'm saying...$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_31|Confidence and a competitive spirit\nare healthy traits in any warrior.$k$pBut you take it too far, Kjelle. I worry\nthat you isolate yourself...$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_2|What's wrong with appreciating strength?$k$pYou're strong, and I respect that about you.\nIt drew me to you, and now we're friends.$k$pIsn't that a good thing?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_10|But consider the opposite case. Would you\nnever befriend someone weaker than you?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_14|...Why would I?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_23|We're not gladiators fighting for coin,\nKjelle. We're at war!$k$pYes, we ought push ourselves to grow as\nindividuals, but in the end we are a team!$k$pWe must join together as a whole,\neach of us supporting the other.$k$pThat is the only way this war will be won.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_13|I understand your thinking, but...$k$pGods, just thinking about those\nweaklings makes my stomach churn!$k$pI see them rolling around the battlefield,\nmewling like kittens and... Ugh!$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_26|Then let us do it your way.\nI challenge you to a duel!$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_4|Er, what?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_11|If you beat me, I will acknowledge your\nphilosophy as the truth.$k$pShould you wish it, the two of us can leave\nthis army and form our own force.$k$pBut if I win, you must swear to acknowledge\nyour allies as equals.$k$pStrong and weak, warrior and healer alike.\nWe face the enemy as one!$k$pUnited we stand, divided―$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_8|Okay, enough! I yield!\n...You win.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_21|...Huh?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_9|I know better than to fight you when you\nhave that look in your eye!$k$p...Plus, your speech had my stomach\nchurning even more than the weaklings.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_34|Then you'll do as I've asked?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_6|Indeed.$k$pI'm sorry, Lucina. I know at times my ego\ncan be difficult to deal with.$k$pI may be strong, but I am very aware I'm\nnot strong enough to win a war alone.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_38|I'm pleased to hear it.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_19|I still think strength is important!\nThat's not changing.$k$pBut maybe it's time I started being\nmore...inclusive?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_21|Oh? What did you have in mind?$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_5|Yes, I'll train the rest of this sorry lot\nuntil they meet my standards!$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_19|Excellent! I'm sure the others will be\nthrilled to have your help in training.$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_22|$Eキメ,|We'll get a tougher fighting force, and I\nwon't have to look at weaklings all day!$k$pIt's a win-win arrangement!$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_28|Assuming everyone is able to\nkeep up with your training...$k\n$Wsデジェル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_DEGEL_EVT_6|As you said, we're all equals.\nNo exceptions, no special treatment!$k$pIt's time these Shepherds were truly\nrun through their paces!$k$pNow, a daily 10-mile run would be a good\nstart. Then perhaps...100 log-lifts? 200?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_23|$E苦,汗|Perhaps this wasn't such\na grand idea after all...$k\n$Sbs1000|
