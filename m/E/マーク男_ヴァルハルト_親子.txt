I wonder why I have no memory\nof my father...$k$pAll my memories of Mother are so\ncrisp and clear...$k$pI remember what an amazing tactician she\nwas, all the time we studied together...$k$pBut nothing at all about my father.\nIt's one big blank.$k\n$Wmヴァルハルト|3$w0|$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_1|What is the meaning of\nall this navel-gazing?$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_1|Father! That's amazing!\nI was just thinking about you!$k$pIs this fate?! This is totally fate!\nFamily-style fate!$k$p$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_24|...Wait, no. How did Mother put it?$k$p"We're not pawns of some scripted fate.\nIt's the invisible ties we forge that bind us."$k$p$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_11|So yeah, it's not fate. It's the\nwhole invisible bond-link...thing!$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_3|Absurd. It is through strength\nalone that man―$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_3|Yup!

You're a genius!$k$pI must have seen your face a million times\nin the future.$k$pIt's bound to bring SOMETHING back\nif I stare at it long enough.$k$p$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_11|Okay, sorry to invade your personal space\nhere, but...
