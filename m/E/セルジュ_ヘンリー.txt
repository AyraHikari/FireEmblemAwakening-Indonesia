Have you come\nby to pet Minerva?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_19|Sure have! She's as cute as a button,\nthat one. ...Well, if buttons were cute.$k$pWe had wyverns in Plegia, you know,\nand also the occasional fell beast.$k$pBut we didn't have a single wyvern\nthat was as pretty as Minerva.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_17|You're very astute.
