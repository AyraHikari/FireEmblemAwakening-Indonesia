Isn't that a pickle!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_9|Buying for royalty would be hard enough,\nbut we're in the middle of a war.$k$pIt'd have to be small, to transport easily\nwith the caravan, and nothing excessive...$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_16|Yeah, cheap is good. Chrom's never\nbeen much for gold and glitter, anyway.$k$pI was actually thinking of brewing up\na special concoction for him.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_5|You mean like a potion or tonic?\nI didn't know you dabbled in such!$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_9|My father is an apothecary,\nand he taught me the trade.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_11|Homemade gifts are always the best!\nWould that I possessed any such talents...$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_2|Er, say.
