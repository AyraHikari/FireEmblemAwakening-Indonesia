Ooh, or maybe magic?$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_23|If you wish to know the answer,\nbathe in the waters of the spring.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_4|But the spring is...really, really cold.\nCouldn't we just do flower fortunes?$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_20|No. Now do as I say and go to the spring.\nYou'll find your answer there.$k$pYou'll have to think long and hard,\nthough.

Have you found\nyour answer yet?$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_6|Yep. After you posed the question,\nI thought and thought and thought...$k$pBut I couldn't think of anything, so I did\nwhat you said and bathed in the spring.$k$pThat's when I noticed my poor pegasus\nwas as dirty as a farm hog!$k$pI'd been so busy making MYSELF look\ngrand, I neglected my faithful mount!$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_8|Ah, good. You understand at last.$k$pA knight's pegasus isn't some beast\nof burden or a farmer's mule.$k$pShe is a partner and ally, and must be cared\nfor as much as a knight cares for herself.$k$p...A lesson which I can see you've learned.\nYour mount is looking radiant today.$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_3|Oh, yes! I've started washing and brushing\nher every day now.$k$pI want her to look as fine and proud as\nyour pegasus, Mom!$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_23|Hee hee!

What is it?$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_9|Our two pegasi seem so similar,\ndon't you think?$k$pSo similar, in fact, that I'm wondering...$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_2|Yep! My pegasus is the very same one\nthat you used to ride.$k$pWhen my mother was killed back in my time,\nher pegasus made its way back to me.$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_19|I see...$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_11|She told me what Mother said\njust before she died...$k$p"Please, return to Cynthia. Look after her\nand protect her."$k$pShe―well, you―sent your pegasus to me so\nI'd have something to remember you by.$k$pAll of which makes me feel TOTALLY\nworse for not taking better care of her!$k$pShe's been my stalwart friend and ally\never since, but I don't even deserve her!$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_14|Now, now, Cynthia.\nThat's not true.$k$pYou made a mistake, but you recognize\nthat now.$k$pYou have lots of time to make it up to her\nand strengthen the bonds of trust.$k$pAfter all, you're not the only one who\never neglected her pegasus...$k\n$Wsシンシア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CYNTHIA_EVT_4|Y-you used to forget to wash her, too?$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_9|Wash her?

I'm so relieved to hear it...\nOh, Mother, I can't thank you enough.$k$pYou've taught me so many things that I\ndidn't have a chance to ask about before.$k$pYou really are everything the legends say!\n...Well, maybe a bit more clumsy, but...$k\n$Sbs1000|
