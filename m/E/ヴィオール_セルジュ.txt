Surely you know by now that\ngallant Virion always speaks from the heart!$k$pIf I had not been so cruelly robbed of\nmy domains, you would still―$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_11|But you DID lose your lands, so there's no\npoint discussing what might have been.$k$pThis is reality, where we face each other\non the training ground as equals.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_12|Ah, reality.

But I never served\nyou because of your land holdings.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_10|You didn't? Oh ho ho! Then was it,\nperchance, for love?$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_16|One more comment like that and\nI'll have Minerva eat you.$k\n$Wsヴィオール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_VIAUR_EVT_20|*Gulp* My deepest apologies, milady!\nMy lips are hereby sealed!$k\n$Sbs1000|

That was a tragedy,\nand many of my people died.$k$pI'll not have you speak so lightly\nof it.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_11|That was not my intent, Virion.
