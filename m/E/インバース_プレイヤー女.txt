I'll now return to my duties.$k$pIf you require anything else, you have\nbut to summon me.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wd$w0|$Wmusername|7$w0|$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_13|...Was that Aversa? What was she\ndoing in Chrom's tent?$k$pHey, Aversa! Hold a moment!$k\n$Wmインバース|3$w0|$Wsインバース|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_5|Why, if it isn't the former tactician.\nWhat do you want with me, woman?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_5|Former? What do you mean by that?$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_2|Just what I said. Oh, you've done a decent\nenough job as tactician up to now...$k$pBut I think we all agree it's time you took\na break and let the professionals take over.$k$pGo put your feet up, and have a cup of tea.\nChrom's little army is safe in my hands now.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_7|You scheming witch! I'M the tactician.\nI always have been, and I always will be.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_3|Heh. Well, that's not really up to you,\nnow is it?$k$pChrom and his soldiers need the best,\nand the best happens to be me.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_32|Are you saying you know more about\nrunning a battle than I do?$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_10|Must I spell it out for you?$k$pWhen we faced off against each other,\nwhose fingers got burned the most?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_29|I'll grant that you were a challenging foe,\nbut it was I who claimed ultimate victory.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_5|Ah! I think I see the source of your\nconfusion... Allow me to clarify.$k$pYou think Chrom won BECAUSE of you,\nwhereas, in fact, he won DESPITE you.$k$pTrust me. When I'm his tactician, this\ncampaign will go much more smoothly.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_31|You try and twist the words around your\nforked tongue, but the truth won't bend.$k$pI know what I've done, what I've achieved.\nYour lies don't change that.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_3|Well, well! The little woman has some\nfire in her yet...$k$pClearly she won't give up her playthings\nwithout a tantrum...$k$pStill, time and ability are on my side.\nI'll soon have your precious position.$k$pThen Chrom will realize it's me that\nhe wants! ME! Hoo ho ho hee hee heh!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_36|...I suppose I shouldn't be surprised\nby any of this, really.$k\n$Sbs1000|

CHROM? ...Now where did he go?\nI was sure he was around here somewhere.$k\n$Wmusername|7$w0|$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_18|Hello, Aversa. Looking for Chrom?$k$p$E笑,|If you have a message, perhaps you\ncan leave it with his tactician.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_4|When a lady needs to see her lord,\nthere's no need to involve former staff.$k$pEspecially when it's of a personal nature.$k$pChrom and his NEW tactician have\nprivate business. ...So run along.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_7|I see your fantasy life is as rich as ever.$k$p$E通常,|To think such a delusional fool would\never become tactician. Ha!$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_5|Delusional? I think not. Chrom is a hot-\nblooded man, after all, and young besides.$k$pAnd when two young, passionate people\nare thrown together in such situations...$k$pWell, sparks can fly.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_50|Two young people? You must be a dozen\nyears older than him if you're a day.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_11|Why, you insolent little... Eight years!\nThat's all I have on him! Eight!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_18|It might as well be a century.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_18|Gya! If it wasn't for my impeccable social\ngraces, I'd teach you some manners...$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_36|Hah! I'm sure an alley cat like yourself can\ndo little more than scratch and hiss...$k$p$E通常,|But I won't be found brawling in the\nmud like a circus act.$k$pStrategists must set an example.\n...Which you should know.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_22|You would lecture me on decorum?\nAfter your comment on my age?$k$p$E通常,|Very well. Since you refuse to see reason,\nyou leave me no alternative...$k$pI challenge you to a duel!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_7|A duel?! Pah!$k$pYou truly see that as an appropriate\nway to decide who becomes tactician?$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_9|Yes! My second will let you\nknow the time and place.$k$pIf you flee, or do not appear,\nI will win by default.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wd$w0|$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_9|Wait, what?! Hold on!\nI didn't agree to anything!$k\n$Sbs1000|

We're supposed to be\nbattling a common foe, not each other.$k$p$E怒,|But if it's a fight you want, then a fight\nyou shall have.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_10|To the victor goes the spoils!\nNow, might shall decide what's right!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_36|Come and get―$k$p$E通常,汗|...Hold on. ...I can't help but\nfeel like we're being watched.$k$pAre you certain we're the only\nones out here?$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_11|Of course I am.$k$p...Unless you planted\nan ambush!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_7|Why in blazes would I bring it\nup if they were my own men?!$k\n$Sbs500|$Wsインバース|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_17|If they aren't yours... And they\naren't mine... They must be...$k$pThe enemy?!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_28|Then your defeat will have to wait.$k$pWe must join forces until we can\nget back to the camp. Agreed?$k$pNow let's move!$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_22|And here I had such terrible things\nplanned for you...$k$p*Sigh* Yes, we fight as allies\nfor now.

When'd you set that trap?\nPlanning to cheat in our little duel?$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_15|You're one to talk! Who was it that cut the\nescape route through the woods?$k$pYou wanted to make sure you had a way\nout in case our fight didn't go your way.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_20|You weren't complaining about it when\nwe fled to safety, were you?$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_10|...Well, I may have been a LITTLE\nglad for it at the time.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_14|If we didn't have each other, we'd both\nbe in Risen stomachs right now.$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_28|Who would have thought we'd\nmake such an effective team?$k$pPerhaps... Perhaps you and I should try\nworking together for a change.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_16|Are you offering to help with\ntactical planning?$k$pHmm... You would bring a lot\nof experience, at least...$k\n$Wsインバース|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_INVERSE_EVT_9|It's settled, then. We shall help each other.\nFor now. But make no mistake.$k$pI'll be right behind you...\nAnd the first time you slip up...$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_36|You'll jump in and install yourself as\nChrom's right-hand woman?
