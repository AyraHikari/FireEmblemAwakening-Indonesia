So this is where\nyou've been hiding.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_1|......$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|I was actually hoping to ask for\nyour advice. Is now a good time?$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_5|Groveling ill suits you. Remember that\nyou are my superior in this army.$k$pNow state your business, tactician.\nWhat advice do you seek?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_11|We're expecting tough battles\nahead, as you know.$k$pSo I was wondering what your approach\nwould be if you were in charge.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_7|I cannot help you in this.$k$pI had little need for battle plans and plots.$k$pLittle need for the cunning trickery of the\ntactician...$k$pI won battles on the mettle of my soldiers\nand the strength of our beliefs.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_13|So you rejected strategy entirely?$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_13|I was the Conqueror! Master of all men.\nMy domain stretched from sea to sea!$k$pI held no disdain for your strategy.\nI simply had no need of it.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_23|So all was decided on the battlefield?\nMan-to-man and steel to steel?$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_5|Yes. But clearly mine was the wrong way.\nFor it is I who stand here as your servant―$k$pI who am tarred forever with the ignominy\nand shame of ultimate defeat.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_8|Though we question your motives,\nthere is no shame in losing a war.$k$pYou fought bravely and well.\nNobody thinks less of you in defeat.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_11|Fool! Of course they do! They think\nme weak, and they are correct.$k$pIf a man demands respect at the end of\na sword, he has none left when it shatters.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|Walhart, you lost a single battle.\nThat hardly makes you weak.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_21|It does in my world. But I know that Chrom\nbelieves differently, and he is the victor.$k$pThe vanquished have no right to their own\nconvictions―they must follow their masters.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_20|But it's a healthy thing to have a mix of\ndifferent beliefs, new ways of doing things...$k$pEven if we don't agree with them, learning\nabout other ideas only makes us stronger.$k$pYou must promise not to forsake your views.\nI could learn something from your ways.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_4|You speak as a child that has captured\na particularly interesting insect...$k$pBut no matter. I shall indulge your whim.\nThere are worse ways to pass the time.$k\n$Sbs2000|

I was hoping\nwe might talk more.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_1|Come again to shake the jar of your\ncaptive insect, have you?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_16|Your words, not mine. I'm simply hoping\nyou can tell me more about your views.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_15|I don't know what fascination they hold,\nbut you should remember this...$k$pChrom was the victor, and together you\nhave the power to vanquish all.$k$pYou don't need the delusions of the\ndefeated to make you stronger.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_14|That's where you're wrong, Walhart.\nIt was a miracle that we prevailed.$k$pThe slightest nudge of the scales, and the\noutcome would've been far different.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_6|Pah! There's no such thing as miracles.\nYou won by cunning and might alone.$k$p$E苦,汗|And I lost because of my own weakness.\nA weakness exposed by you!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_11|So you believe all victors to be powerful,\nand all defeated weak. Is this accurate?$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_5|You have the right of it.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|Furthermore, you assert that the weak are\nobliged to obey the powerful. Is this so?$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_7|That, too, is my belief.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_12|Then change it.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_1|...Explain.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_20|Where there's life, there's a will.

The very idea...$k$pYet, as it comes from my victorious rival,\nI am obliged to consider it.$k$pVery well, tactician. I shall meditate\nupon your words, and we will speak again.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_17|That's all I ask.$k\n$Sbs1000|

What are\nyou doing here?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|It's time I sorted my old tomes, so I've\nunpacked the entire library.$k$pI didn't realize how many books I've\ncollected!

What are you doing?$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_1|You were struggling under the load.\nI decided to assist.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_31|Riiight. But you're holding me,\nnot the books...?$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_15|It seemed the quickest way to help.\nBut if it displeases you...$k$p...There. Safely on your\nown two feet again.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_9|*Cough* Er, thank you.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_12|Why do you carry your own tomes?$k$pSurely such menial work could be assigned\nto the grunts. Or prisoners of war.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_5|We do NOT enslave prisoners of war in\nthis army, Walhart!$k$pAnd for that matter, we don't refer to any\nof our soldiers as "grunts."$k$pEveryone is on equal terms here.\nMenial tasks are shared by all.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_3|Why am I not surprised at such a sickening\ndisplay of misguided democracy?$k$pVery well, then. ORDER me to carry\nyour books.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_7|Er...I don't think I'm comfortable with that.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_13|You are an army of equals, yes?\nMenial tasks are shared by all?$k$pThen even the great Walhart should\nnot be above such things!$k$pOr do you just pay lip service to "equality"\nwhile the hierarchy is alive and well?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_14|Fine. You win. ...Walhart, I order you\nto carry my books.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_20|Gladly. ...Hmm? This trunk is\nhardly heavy at all!$k$pBah. The tactician who brought down my\narmy has the strength of a mewling kitten!$k$p'Tis amusing to think such a brilliant\nwarmonger can barely lift a box of papers.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_15|It wasn't me who brought you down.\nIt was the combined strength of our army.$k$pMeasured one against one, I'd barely come\nup to your ankle. ...Figuratively speaking.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_23|Yet you have the power to marshal the\ncollective strength of your fellow men.$k$p$E笑,|The people of this world could do far worse\nthan to have you as supreme ruler.$k$pI wager you could bring the prosperity\nand peace they've long yearned for.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_18|I didn't realize you cared so much\nabout the lives of the smallfolk.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_6|It was my methods that were wrong,\nnot my motives.$k$p...It all fell apart once I began to worship\nmight for its own sake.$k$pThat wicked Grimleal fanatic whispering\nlies in my ear didn't help matters...$k$pThe responsibility was all mine,\nbut I can't help but think...$k$pWhat if I'd met you instead of Excellus?\nPerhaps I'd have seen the error of my ways.$k$pPerhaps I'd have become the benevolent\nmonarch I first set out to be...$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_21|It's not too late. You still have the power to\nput things right. To improve the lives of all.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_1|I can scarce believe such folly.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_20|Remember what I told you before?$k$pWhere there's life, there's a will. And where\nthere's will, there is the power to change.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_7|...Very well.$k$pAs you have spoken truth to me before,\nI shall trust you and your words.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_16|It's all true.\nYou'll see...$k\n$Sbs1000|

About how I SHOULD change.$k\n$Wsusername|$WaGo on...$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_15|Since you and Chrom defeated me,\nI've learned a great deal.$k$pFor example, about Emmeryn's vision\nfor the world...$k$pIt is a vision I would very much like\nto see come true.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_21|That is...very surprising.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_5|I don't know rightly if this is\nwhat you meant by "change."$k$pBut I know what my mission is now.$k$pI'm going to work for a future where\nEmmeryn's dream is a reality.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_16|Why, that's wonderful, Walhart!\nIt truly is.$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_28|Then I know it is the right decision.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_17|You know, Walhart, you used to be so\nintimidating and angry, but now look at you!$k\n$Wsヴァルハルト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_WALTRUD_EVT_1|Yes, I did come across that way...$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_11|Beneath all the bluster and menace,\nyou have...dare I say it?

Take what you've learned,\nand try again, but do it differently.$k$pYour goal hasn't changed.
