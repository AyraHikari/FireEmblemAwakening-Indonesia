Was it you playing?$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_7|You are kind to say so. But in truth,\nI'm quite out of practice.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_12|What? No, you play beautifully! And one\nof my favorite Ylissean folk songs, to boot!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_6|It's been so long since last I played.$k$pWhen I saw this harp at the local\nmarket, I just couldn't resist.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_2|I remember how you entranced the court\nby playing at Chrom's birthday ceremony.$k$pThose were some good times...$k$pSay, why don't you put on an encore\nperformance? It'd be huge for morale!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_9|Oh, that court concert was a long time\nago. I don't even remember the music.$k$pAlthough I suppose I could muddle through\nif I had the score in front of me.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_5|Wait, you were just playing from memory?\nThat's even more impressive!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_5|Please, Stahl, I'm serious.\nStop trying to flatter me.$k$pCompared to Phila, I'm\njust a clumsy amateur.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_9|Well, sure. But Phila was the best I've seen.\nShe could have joined the royal orchestra.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_7|I always dreamed that one day I might\nbe as skilled as her. It's silly, I know.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_11|Hey, never say never! Especially when\nyou're so abundantly talented.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_16|Stop it, seriously! See, now I'm\njust getting embarrassed...$k$p$E通常,|Er, oh, hey! Would you look at that?\nIt's chore time. ...Gotta go!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wd$w0|$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_6|That Cordelia...

Yes, I was―\nUm, is that a harp?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvjSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_11|$SveSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_9|Yep! Just bought it down at the market.\nOh, and I got some sheet music, too.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_16|Heh. Sounds like someone is\nitching to play a duet!$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_13|Well, at some point, sure. But right now\nI can barely make noise on this thing.$k$pI was hoping you might be my teacher\ninstead of my duet partner.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_7|Well, I've never taught before,\nbut I'd be happy to help.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_18|I'm going to practice like a madman\nuntil I'm good enough to play with you.$k$pI'll practice until my fingers are bloody\nand raw! I'll practice until my eyes―$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_6|Well, it's...good to have a goal.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_7|Hey, I'm just trying to be as dedicated\nto things as you are, Cordelia.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_16|Heh. Perhaps I have been\nTOO dedicated...$k$pSpeaking of which, I think we\nshould start your lesson.$k$pNow, watch carefully as I pluck\nthe first few bars of this song...$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_9|You have my undivided attention.$k$p......$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_18|Er, won't your eyes dry out if you\nkeep them open so wide?$k$pEr, right, then. Never mind.\nLet me begin...$k$p......$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_6|$E怒,|Wow, you played that\nnote so beautifully...$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_14|Huh? No, I didn't!$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_5|No, no! The tone was lovely!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_13|Stahl, it's just one note.\nWill you please let me finish?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_7|Er, yes. Right. Sorry.\nGo ahead.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_7|...Look, I don't think I'm quite\nready for teaching.$k$pGive me some time to work out\na lesson plan, okay?$k$pI don't want to do this until I'm\nsure my methods are...sound.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wd$Wsソール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_22|But, Cordelia!$k$pGods, she's more of a perfectionist than\nI thought. This is going to be tough.$k\n$Sbs1000|

Yes, the song\nyou're playing...right now.$k$p$E笑,|Goodness, Stahl, you're doing very well!\nHow did you learn that?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_4|When I saw how passionate you were about\na single note, I knew I had to practice.$k$pI'm still kind of murdering it, but\nI think it's getting better...$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_12|I wouldn't say murder!\n...Maybe more like assault.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_11|I knew I had to work twice as hard as\nyou if I wanted to play that duet.$k$pSo I've been practicing every waking\nmoment―even in the latrines!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_17|Oh! Um, yes, that is...quite dedicated.$k$p$E通常,|By the by, I've never heard that song played\nwith the faster tempo you employed.$k$pI rather like it! Such a nice twist\non an old classic.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_5|Yeah, it's just an idea that struck me\nas I was studying the notes.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_6|How very astute of you.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_17|I think it was more blind luck\nthan astuteness, but thanks.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_5|Stahl? There are many in this camp\nwho play the harp better than I.$k$pWhy have you settled on me for\nthis duet and concert idea?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_12|Because you don't just play...\nYou make the harp sing!$k$pYou can do anything, Cordelia.\nYou have a natural gift.$k$p$E笑,|I wish I could be more like you!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_9|I'm not sure that being naturally gifted\nat something is always a good thing.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_5|$E通常,|Muh?$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_8|Well, if you don't have talent, it takes a lot\nof time and effort to acquire a new skill.$k$pAnd through that process, you learn things\nthat more naturally talented people miss.$k$pLike your discovery of the faster tempo.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_14|$E怒,|Hmm... I suppose so.$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_17|$E笑,|And that persistence leads to you\nbecoming just as good as anyone else.$k$pTo be honest, there are times when I've\nthought I'd rather be more like you!$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_7|Hah! Well, we can't BOTH be right!$k\n$Wsティアモ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_TIAMO_EVT_7|This isn't about right or wrong. It's just\ntwo ways of looking at the same problem.$k$p...In any case, your practice has paid off,\nand I name you my equal in the harp.$k$pWe should play that duet soon.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_19|It would be my honor!$k\n$Sbs1000|
