Laurent, you sound\njust like mother.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvjSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_9|$SveSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|Naturally. She IS my mother.$k\n$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_2|Gregor understand this, but still...$k$pYou two are peas in pod, yes? Gregor often\nwonder if you inherit anything from him.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|Don't be absurd, Father.\nOf course I did.$k\n$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_9|Oh? For the example?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Like...the color of my hair.$k\n$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_8|Er, perhaps, yes, but that not exactly\nwhat Gregor was talking about.$k$pAnything more sizable? Do you enjoy\nbear wrestling and clinking of coin?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|Hmm, no. My bearing in that respect\nis profoundly normal.$k$pVery much to my relief, if I might be\nperfectly frank.$k\n$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_12|Oy, see what Gregor mean?\nAlways with the serious...$k$pYou should try loosen up a little.\nMaybe act more like your age.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_27|We're at war, Father. Acting like a child\nis hardly behavior to be encouraged.$k$pBesides, I'm a grown man. Older than\nLucina at this point, I suspect.$k\n$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_6|Eh? Older than Lucina?\nHow is this possible?$k$pLucina already born here, but mother\nand Gregor still not give birth to you.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_15|I...I fear I've no more time to chat today.\nNow, if you'll excuse me.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wd$w0|$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_1|Laurent, wait!

How may I help you?$k\n$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_4|Gregor has been thinking about\nhow you are older than Lucina...$k$pHe...does not understand.\nVery confusing, yes?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_7|It's fairly straightforward. Travel among\neras is imprecise. There are...variables.$k$pLucina arrived at the onset of the war with\nPlegia some two years ago.$k$pI, on the other hand, have been here for\nnearly five years.$k\n$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_3|Oy! That much difference between\nwhen you and Lucina arrive?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|...Indeed.$k$pHence, I have aged three years more than\nshe in the course of reaching this moment.$k$pSomewhere along the way, I passed her\nin terms of physical age.$k\n$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_12|You have been living in this era\nfive years, all by lonesome...?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Yes. So as you see, I'm far too old to be\nindulging in childish behaviors.$k$pI trust that explanation has cleared up\nyour confusion? Now, if you'll excuse me...$k\n$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_1|Laurent, wait! Why did you not make\nwith the telling of this sad tale before?$k$pBeing cut off for five years is long time.\nMust have been very lonely...$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|As I've said time and again,\nI am a grown man.$k$p...I managed fine on my own.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wd$w0|$w500|$Wsグレゴ|$WaLaurent...$k\n$Sbs1000|

All that time, it was...\nI was so lonely.$k$pYear after year, all alone...\nWandering an era where I knew no one.$k$pHoping to meet up with the others but\nknowing how miniscule my chances were...$k$pI had no one to help me. No one to lend an\near to my despair. It was...awful.$k$pMany nights, I thought I'd die alone.\nThat the pain would kill me, or...$k\n$Wsグレゴ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GREGO_EVT_10|Laurent... Gregor feels much shame that\nhe was not able to find you earlier.$k$pBut know this: Gregor will never\nleave your side again.$k\n$Sbs1000|
