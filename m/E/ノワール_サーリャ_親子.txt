M-Mother!\nDid you need something?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_19|What were you doing in that last battle?\nWere you trying to distract me?$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_10|I... Did I? I'm sorry, I didn't\nintend to, I swear.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_21|You mirrored my every movement!\nIt was like some bizarre curse.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_6|Oh. That. Well, you see―$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_5|Don't care. Doesn't matter.\nJust stop.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wd$Wsノワール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_24|N-no, wait! It was force of habit!$k\n$Wmサーリャ|7$w0|$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_8|What...habit?$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_19|In the future, you were always too wrapped\nup in your research to teach me things.$k$pN-not that I blame you! I know\nyou had your reasons...$k$pYou were consumed with avenging Father,\nso you never had time to waste on me.$k$pBut I wanted to help you, so I...$k$pI taught myself magic and dark arts by\nfollowing your example.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_1|And that became a habit?$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_7|Er, well, yeah. I guess.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_5|Hmm...$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_13|O-oh! But if it's a distraction, I'll stop!\nI promise!$k$pSo, um, it'd be really nice if maybe you\ndidn't...put any weird curses on me?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_10|I see... Hmm... I'm thinking this\ncould have its uses...$k$pHeh... Meh heh heh heh...$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_5|Eeeek!$k\n$Sbs1000|

We're performing\nthe rites in perfect sync!$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_2|Hmm... Still no use, then.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_8|"Still"?$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_19|Well, I've... I've never managed to actually\nplace a hex on anyone...$k$pI can use dark magic in combat just fine.$k$pBut the sorts of hexes you deal in, Mother―\nthey've always been beyond me somehow.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_2|That makes no sense. You're able\nto mirror my actions perfectly.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_6|True, but I can only mimic the form.\nNot the substance.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_19|It still doesn't make sense.\nBut then again, none of this does.$k$pWhy wouldn't my future self have taught\nyou how to properly curse people?$k$pIf I was swallowed up in research, I'd never\nturn away a useful assistant...$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_8|I'm not sure. I was pretty young.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_24|Hardly a problem.$k$pI was instructed in the dark arts from\ninfancy.$k$pEven my umbilical cord was cut\nwith a curse.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_5|Ew, gross! What kind of weirdo\ncurses a newborn baby?!$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_23|Meh heh heh... Well, no matter.$k$pThat just means it falls on me to\nshape you into something useful.$k$pOh, and I shall teach you...\nWhether you wish it or not.$k$pHeh... Meh heh heh.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_27|I'm s-scared, Mother...\nBut I'll try to...do my best.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_6|Hmm, yes. Yes, you will...$k\n$Sbs1000|

But...$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_9|I won't be teaching you the dark arts.\nNow put those implements away.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_3|But why? Wh-what did I do?\nDo I lack the talent? Am I in your way?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_10|You have a frightening amount of talent.\nYour innate magical potential is vast.$k$pEven that talisman I made turned\nyou into an entirely different person!$k$pOne couldn't hope for a greater vessel to\nshape into a curse slinger.$k$p...And you could never be in my way.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_14|Then why?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E苦,汗|...I think I've come to understand\nthe motives of my future self.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_10|What?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_20|I don't want you dealing in hexes. The dark\narts carry with them tremendous risks.$k$pMy future self knew as much...$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_2|You think that she was worried for my\nsafety? That...she loved me?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_4|Can't say. Not about her, at least.$k$p...But I love you, if that helps.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_24|Mother...$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_22|Just don't expect to me to say it often!\n...Or maybe ever again.$k$pAnd just because hexes are off the table\ndoesn't mean I have nothing to teach you.$k$pThere are more ways than hexing to\nskin a cat. ...Or other things. Heh.$k$pSo pay attention, and try to follow along.$k\n$Wsノワール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_NOIR_EVT_15|Oh yes, ma'am!$k\n$Sbs1000|
