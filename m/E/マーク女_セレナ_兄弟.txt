I understand, and believe me,\nI appreciate the thought...$k$p$E通常,|But I want to remember things, no matter\nhow painful they are.$k$p$E怒,|Because I'm sure there'll be plenty of great\nmemories mixed with the bad ones.$k$pAnd the truth, whatever it is... I really\nwant to have that back, you know?$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_6|$E通常,|Well, if you're sure,\nthen I gueeess I can help.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_11|That's really kind of you, Severa, but do\nyou truly realize what you're saying?$k$pI mean, it could be years before I\nremember anything.

But you said that doesn't have\nto do with getting my memories back.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_9|Hey, there's no rule that says you can't\nhave a little fun while you try.$k$pAnd there's certainly no rule against making\nsome happy new memories, either.$k$p$E笑,|You're young! Live a little! There'll be\nplenty of time to worry later.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Right... You're right!\nThanks, Sis!$k\n$Sbs1000|
