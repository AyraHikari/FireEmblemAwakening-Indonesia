MID_X018_OP2: $t1$Wmクロム|3$w0|$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_12|Are those the dread pirates we've\nheard so much about?$k\n$Wmフレデリク|7$w0|$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_15|Indeed. Their leader is a man named Zanth,\nthe so-called Southron Sea King.$k$p$E怒,|His crew can stand up to most armies,\nand as such, he holds sway over the south.$k$pExtreme caution should be the order of\nthe day against this one, milord.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_9|$E怒,|Right. Then let's finish our business\nand get out of here!$k
MID_X018_TK1: $t1$Wmクロム|3$Wmギャンレル|7$w0|$Wsギャンレル|$Wa$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_34|$E苦,汗|Wait a minute...\nG-Gangrel?!$k\n$Wsギャンレル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GANGREL_EVT_8|...Gangrel is dead.\nNothing but maggots here.$k\n$Wsギャンレル|$Wd$w0|$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_18|$E苦,汗|Wait! Gangrel!$k$pThat's the Mad King...\nI'm sure of it.$k
MID_X018_TK2: $t1$Wmクロム|3$Wmギャンレル|7$w0|$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_35|$E苦,汗|Gangrel, I know it's you!\nHow are you alive?!$k\n$Wsギャンレル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GANGREL_EVT_9|$E怒,|Alive? No, Chrom. This is not living...$k$p$E笑,|You killed me once, dear prince.\nNow I would beg you do so again.$k$pMy life is over, but my body\nrefuses to accept it.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_3|$E怒,|Gods, listen to you... Is this truly the\nsame Mad King who stood against us?$k\n$Wsギャンレル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GANGREL_EVT_16|Tear out everything that makes a man,\nand all you're left with is a husk.$k$pNo throne. No gold. No men...$k$p$E笑,|I scrub chamber pots for brigands.\nAh, how the mighty have fallen...$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_38|$E怒,|Ironic that you, of all people, are finally\nlearning about long falls.$k\n$Wsギャンレル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GANGREL_EVT_7|Heh. Seems I'm not the only one who's\nchanged, dear prince.$k$pDays past, you'd have sheathed your\nblade in my chest by now.$k$pPerhaps you're less of your father and\nmore of your sister than I thought...$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_10|$E怒,|Your crimes are beyond forgiveness.$k$p$E通常,|But indeed, Emmeryn had a profound\neffect on me, in most every way.$k$pMy only charge now is to save this world.\nI have no time for vendetta.$k\n$Wsギャンレル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GANGREL_EVT_8|$E笑,|How very gracious of you.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_11|Enough, Gangrel. What little life you\nstill have is wasted here.$k$p$E怒,|I can offer you a higher purpose...\nYou could fight for us.$k\n$Wsギャンレル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GANGREL_EVT_13|$E怒,|Heh... NOW who's the mad king?$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_38|I told you, I have no time for vendetta.\nDefeating Grima is all that matters.$k$pAnd while killing you here would please me\ngreatly, it'd put me no closer to that goal.$k$p$E怒,|Since you're no longer my enemy,\nI'd sooner put you to use than see you rot.$k\n$Wsギャンレル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GANGREL_EVT_9|You've changed, little prince.\nI'm almost disappointed.$k$p$E通常,汗|Still, I suppose this is what\ntrue leadership looks like...$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_25|I'd have your answer, Gangrel.$k\n$Wsギャンレル|$Wa$E通常,|......$k$p$SvpSE_VOICE_GANGREL_EVT_8|It was a lovely speech, but I'll pass. I'm just\nnot the sort to play at hope and justice.$k$p$E笑,|If killing me would please you greatly,\nI'll not deny your satisfaction.$k$pCome, boy. Do an old king one last favor\nand end this charade now.$k
