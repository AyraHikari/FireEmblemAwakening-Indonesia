No, I had no such plans.\nThe thought never occurred to me.$k$pBut perhaps it is something to keep\nin mind for the next visit.$k$pThank you, Gaius. I'm glad this chat\nwasn't a complete waste of time.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_13|$E苦,汗|Er... Me, too?$k$pAlthough... Hmm...$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_3|Yes? Something on your mind?$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_12|Well, I'm just thinking...$k$pI mean, let's say you make enough\nsweets for an entire orphanage.$k$pThat's going to be a LOT of sweets,\nright?

I can ask\nfor anything I want, or what?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_9|Well, it is true that many people pray\nto receive things for themselves.$k$pBut originally, prayers were not used\nto beseech the gods for favors.$k$pRather, they were used to give thanks\nfor blessings already received.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_10|Blessings, eh?$k$p$E笑,|So I could say thanks for candied figs and\nhoney cakes? Oh, and fruit pies, too?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_3|Er, yes. I suppose so. If they are something\nyou feel profoundly grateful for.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_15|Profoundly doesn't begin to cover it.$k$p...So, er, do I kneel or what?\nIs there a bench involved somehow?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_4|It is customary to bend the knee\nin supplication, yes.

Ha ha!\nWho's religious now?$k$pI was just praying that I'd be\nunharmed in the next battle.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_3|Oh? That's actually quite sensible.\nPerhaps I was being unfair.$k$pI thought for sure you were dreaming about\nswimming in syrup or some nonsense.$k$pBut why now, if I may? You usually have\nsuch a cavalier attitude toward battle.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_5|Well, in that last battle we fought,\nI had me a pretty close shave.$k$pIf I'd been a split-second slower, my head\nwould have been bouncing across the field.$k$pIt made me think. You never know when\nyour number's going to be up, you know?$k$pAnyway, I figured maybe I should take\nthese prayers a bit more seriously.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_4|Coming face-to-face with one's own\nmortality can have that effect.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_9|But why should the gods pay an\nold sinner like me any mind?$k$pIt's not like I've ever done anything\nto earn their appreciation.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_5|In the eyes of the gods, we are all innocent,\nif only we open our hearts to them.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_15|Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Padre.$k$pI bet you've never once strayed from\nthe straight and narrow.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_11|Oh, if it were only so...$k$p$E通常,|I am as much a sinner as anyone.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_11|You? Lord Squeaky Clean?\nI find that hard to believe.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_14|Think about how many people\nhave died because of me.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E怒,|Huh?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_16|$E苦,|Every time I survive a battle, it means\nothers have died in my place.$k$pAnd when I pray for safety in a fight, it is\nthe same as praying for my foe's death.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_10|Wow. Never thought of that.$k$p...Wait, so I've been praying for\nother people to die, too?!$k$pCrivens! I'm a terrible person!$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_5|Not terrible. Just human.$k$pEvery soldier who prays for\ndeliverance has done the same.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_13|This religion stuff is complicated.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_17|Yet, we should still pray.$k$pWe shall pray for ourselves, and each other,\nand for our allies and comrades.$k$p$E怒,|Even though in doing so, we are praying\nfor the death of strangers.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E怒,|......$k$pO gods...$k\n$Sbs1000|
