I found no\nsign of the enemy nearby.$k$pI believe we are safe here for the night.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_8|Good to hear. Thank you, Frederick.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_15|While on my rounds, I took it upon myself\nto inspect our weaponry as well.$k$pI've placed any items that showed\nexceptional wear outside your pavilion.$k$pBe your choice to sell or repair them, sire,\nI recommend swift action.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_12|$E笑,|...Oh. Well, you HAVE been busy...$k$pYour work ethic always impresses, Frederick.\nI almost feel lazy by comparison.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_11|$E怒,|Nonsense. I've done nothing more than my\nduty as a knight of Ylisse.$k$p$E通常,|Oh, and beg pardon, milord, but I noticed\nyou often cause a ruckus when training.$k$pWith that in mind, I reinforced the tents\nnear any open areas you're like to use.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_23|$E通常,|Er, yes. I see. Sorry for the trouble.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_9|No trouble at all, milord. Happy to help.$k$p...Also, with the nights growing colder,\nI procured blankets from a nearby village.$k$pI've readied a variety of colors so you might\npick that which best suits you.$k$pIf I may be so bold, sire, peach would seem\nto best flatter your complexion.$k$pBut perhaps blue. Just to be safe?\nYes, that's best. Blue it is!$k$pHere you are, milord. And two sets of\nspares, just in case.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_31|Frederick, do you never tire?$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_18|Of course not, milord. I am here to serve.$k$pAh, and one final thing: I've taken measures\nto raise troop numbers and morale.$k$pI had an artisan create posters emblazoned\nwith your noble image.$k$pIt's milord in a bold pose―naked, save a\nscale in one hand and a sword in the other.$k$pAnd at your feet, I scrawled our new\nrecruiting motto: "Chrom Wants You!"$k$pI had them pinned inside each and\nevery tent.$k$p$E笑,|Surely the troops will be thrilled to rally\nbehind their common leader, milord.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_26|...Wait. You did what?!$k$pIn whose... You hung this pict...\nIn EVERYONE'S tent?!$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_21|$E笑,|No need for thanks, milord.\nMerely doing my duty.$k$p$E通常,|And that concludes my report.\nRest well, sire!$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wd$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_25|$E怒,|F-Frederick! Wait! We really need to...$k$ptalk.$k$p$E苦,汗|...Oh, gods. I've got to tear those posters\ndown before anyone sees them!$k\n$Sbs1000|

We need to talk.$k$pI know everything you do is for my sake,\nand I appreciate it. But it's...$k$p$E苦,汗|Well, at times, it's a little extreme.\nAnd other times it's damn near traumatic!$k$pI'm a grown man, Frederick, and I'm\ncapable of taking care of myself.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_11|$E通常,|'Tis not my place to doubt your capability,\nmilord, but I've duties as a knight.$k$p$E怒,|If anything were to happen to you or Lissa,\nI couldn't...$k$pI don't know if I could stand it.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_12|$E怒,|But you do see the difference between\nbeing a knight and being a nanny?$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_20|...I'm sorry, milord, but I would risk your\nembarrassment rather than forsake my duty.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_38|$E通常,|...Fine! Fine. Let's try this again.$k$pLet's pretend you're "milord," and I'm\nyour loyal knight.$k$pNow, let's say you sneeze.\nJust one little sneeze...$k$pSuddenly I come dashing up to you with\nblanket and tea in hand!$k$pOr, let's imagine you make an off-hand\nremark about how fish sounds good...$k$pAnd I ride across two mountains to\na freezing river to secure dinner!$k$pOr, heavens preserve us, let's suppose\nyou look tired, or perhaps even yawn...$k$pSo I bring a parade of increasingly arcane\nherbal cures to your tent for the next hour!$k$p$E怒,|How would that make you feel?$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$WaMilord, I...$k$p$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_23|I would be enraged, milord.\nAnd humiliated.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_11|$E苦,汗|You see? At some point, such assistance\nbecomes a burden.$k$p$E通常,|I respect your sense of duty as a knight,\nbut you must be sane about it!$k$pYou waste too much time and energy on my\nsister and myself, and it saddens us.$k$p$E怒,|If you want to make us happy, take some\ntime for yourself. Relax! Enjoy your life!$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_6|$E怒,|...Is that an order, sire?$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_6|$E通常,|*Sigh* If it was, I've no doubt\nyou would obey without question.$k$pBut that would defeat the point.$k$pIt's not an order, Frederick. It's a request.\n...From one friend to another.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_22|$E苦,汗|Milord...$k$p$E怒,|Very well. If it is your wish, I shall limit my\nactions to a bare minimum.$k$p$Eキメ,|I apologize for any trouble my efforts may\nhave caused until now.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_8|$E笑,|Thanks for understanding.\nAnd for your dedication.$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_15|$E笑,|It is my pleasure to serve, milord.\nEr, that is...within reason.$k\n$Sbs1000|

Are you clearing the gravel?!\nFrederick, what in the world are you doing?!$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_18|$E通常,|It wouldn't do to have you trip up and\nhurt yourself, sire! Surely you see...$k$p$E笑,|...Ah! Are you worried you could\ntrip over ME, then? Of course.$k$pNot to worry, sire! I have a plan that will\nlet me clear the path well ahead of you.$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_31|Um...Frederick?$k\n$Wsフレデリク|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FREDERIK_EVT_13|$E通常,|Is something amiss, milord?$k$pAh, of course!
