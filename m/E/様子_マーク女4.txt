MID_様子_マーク女_前_敬さん: How would you feel about joining\nforces in the next battle?
MID_様子_マーク女_後_敬さん: Of course! I'm no match for my father, but\nI'll think of some plan to see us through!
MID_様子_マーク女_前_親子_母: Mother, tell me about your life until you\nmet me. I want to know all about you.
MID_様子_マーク女_後_親子_母: Well, I can't remember anything about the\nfuture.$k$pBut seeing how close you and Father are\nnow, I imagine you will be then, too.$k$pI must have been so happy. So lucky!\nBut...that's all I can come up with.$k$pI'm sorry.
MID_様子_マーク女_前_親子_父: Hey, Father! What was your life like before\nyou met me?
MID_様子_マーク女_後_親子_父: The future? I hardly remember anything,\nso I'm not sure what to say.$k$pI certainly don't remember the impending\ndoom and despair Lucina speaks of.$k$p...It's hard to believe that's how the world\nwill turn out.
MID_様子_マーク女_前_恋人: Go easy on yourself, $Np.\nIt would sadden me to lose you.
MID_様子_マーク女_後_恋人: Don't worry. I promise to stay alive.\nI've even devised a few strategies. Ha!
