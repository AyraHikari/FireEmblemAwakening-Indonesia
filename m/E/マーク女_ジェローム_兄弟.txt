I can just imagine...$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_16|You're still as cheerful, that's for sure.\nAnd as talkative as ever...$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_18|I am? I mean, I was?!$k$pHmm, now that you mention it, that does\nsound...right, somehow.$k$p$E苦,汗|...Heh. Everything still feels funny.

Sorry about that.$k$pBut that's just another reason why I'm\nworking hard to get my memories back.$k$pOnce I do, nobody will have to feel\nweird or awkward around me again.$k$p$E通常,|Pretty noble, huh? I'm such a sweet,\nselfless girl!$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_2|...And so humble, too.$k$p$E通常,|Anyway, I'm happy to try and help you get\nthose memories back however I can.$k$p$E笑,|I'm looking forward to having someone to\nlaugh with about old times―now included.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Heh, right!$k\n$Sbs1000|

Gerome!$k$p$E苦,汗|Wh-what am I doing here? Was I asleep?!$k$pI don't even remember feeling tired...$k$p$E笑,|Oh, right! I was bashing that huge tome\nagainst my head when I blacked out.$k$pThat explains why my face hurts so bad...$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_8|Why in the world would you do\nsomething like that?!$k$p...Wait, were you trying to get\nyour memories back?$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Well, yeah!

That's just basic science.$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_2|...Good night, Morgan.$k\n$Sbs1000|

Is there something\nin particular you need?$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_3|I might pick up a couple\nof things, yes.$k$pBut mostly I think there's\nsomething YOU need.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_5|It doesn't have to do with getting\nmy memories back, does it?$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_7|The opposite, really.$k$pPerhaps there's no need to\nworry about your memories.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_7|That...makes no sense.$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_10|In truth, I find it a bit hard to swallow\nthat you've forgotten me...$k$pBut perhaps it's better to build new\nmemories than to worry about old ones.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_10|What do you mean?$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_5|I've given this a lot of thought. Why you\nmight have lost your memories, I mean.$k$pAnd I'm wondering if you didn't have some\nawful memory you couldn't bear to keep.$k$p$E苦,汗|I know I have so very many.$k$pPeople we couldn't save...\nLives needlessly wasted...$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|......$k$p$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_27|I'm sorry you have to bear those\ndreadful memories, Gerome...$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_16|It is only a theory, and even if true, I don't\nbelieve it's anything you did consciously.$k$pBut I do think that getting your memories\nback might not be a good thing.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_17|$E笑,|Hmm... I understand, and believe me,\nI appreciate the thought...$k$p$E通常,|But I want to remember things, no matter\nhow painful they are.$k$p$E怒,|Because I'm sure there'll be plenty of great\nmemories mixed with the bad ones.$k$pAnd the truth, whatever it is... I really\nwant to have that back, you know?$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_13|Well, if you're sure,\nthen I am happy to help.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_11|That's really kind of you, Gerome, but do\nyou truly realize what you're saying?$k$pI mean, it could be years before I\nremember anything. Or decades.$k$pHeck, there's a decent chance I may\nnever get my memories back at all.$k$pI don't want to drag you into something\nthat could last forever.$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_17|I'm already stuck with you forever.\nI'm your brother.$k$pWe're family―memories or no.\nYou couldn't keep me away.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_31|Gerome, I... *sniff* Thank you!$k$p$E笑,|I'll do everything I can!$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_10|Then climb up on Minerva and\ncome with me to town.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_5|Huh? But you said that doesn't have\nto do with getting my memories back.$k\n$Wsジェローム|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_JEROME_EVT_5|There's no rule that says you can't\nhave a little fun while you try.$k$pAnd there's certainly no rule against\nmaking happy new memories, either.$k$p$E笑,|You're young yet. There will be plenty\nof time for worry later.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Right... You're right!\nThanks, Brother!$k\n$Sbs1000|
