Is something wrong?$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_9|Well, duh! Yes, something is wrong!$k$pWhat was that nonsense at\nthe war council just now?!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|What, with the battle\nscenario simulations?$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_8|On the last one, you said we should\nlet the enemy retreat. Are you daft?!$k$pAnyone with half a brain would know to\npursue and finish off the enemy! Gawds!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_11|I considered pursuit, but it seemed\ntoo risky.$k$p$E通常,|Factoring in everyone's exhaustion from the\nfirst round, it seemed safest to stay put.$k$pChasing a bear into its den can be asking\nfor trouble, especially after a long fight.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_16|Unless you actually want to SLAY the bear,\nin which case it's exactly what you do!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_10|I think it really depends on the\ncircumstances...$k$pIn that scenario, we would've been chasing\nthem into rugged, mountainous terrain.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_5|So?!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_22|So they can't travel at speed through those\nmountains. It's just not possible.$k$pThat leaves us plenty of time to finish\nthem off once we're back at full strength.$k$pBesides, if a storm hit while we were\nmarching, we'd be devastated.$k$pMountains are fickle things. I thought it\nbest to play it safe in that case.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_18|...You just think you've got ALL the\nanswers, don't you?$k$p$E怒,|You sure have gotten a big head since\nChrom made you our tactician...$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_29|Hey, I hardly think that's fair...$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_9|Oh, so you DON'T think you're the\nsmartest one here? How humble of you!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_10|All right, then. Let's say you were the\ntactician in the same situation.$k$pWhat would you do, Severa? How would you\ndirect the Shepherds to pursue the enemy?$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_5|HA! Don't think you can trick me\nwith your...trickery!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_20|It's not a trick. I'm honestly curious.\nIf you have a solid plan, then great.$k$pI don't want to let them retreat any more\nthan you do, after all.$k$pTake a while to think on it, and let me know.\nRight now, I need to meet with Chrom.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wd$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_10|Oooh! The big man has a big meeting!\n...Gawds, he thinks he's so clever.$k\n$Sbs1000|

Found you!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_13|Did you need something, Severa?$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_18|Don't play dumb with me. I'm here with\nan answer to your little question.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_18|Ah, how best to pursue enemies fleeing\ninto mountainous terrain? Excellent!$k$pAnd what is your solution?$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_8|You let the main force rest, but send a small\nstrike force of your best fighters.$k$pThat way, you minimize risk while also\nhaving the best chance of killing the foe.$k$pWhat do you think about that?!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_11|It sounds reasonable enough...$k$p$E通常,|But what if their retreat was just a ruse,\nand they littered the mountain with traps?$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_13|H-hey! You didn't say\nanything about traps!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_10|Without knowing anything about the path\nahead, sending anyone is a risk.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_9|Yeah, and so that's why you send\nyour best men and minimize casualties!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_14|...Not good enough.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_4|Not good enough?!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_15|Chrom and I aren't trying for fewer\ncasualties, Severa. We're trying for none.$k$pAnytime we lose a fighter, the operation\nis a failure―no matter the end result.$k$pYour plan is a compromise we're just not\nwilling to take.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_9|Oh. My. Gawds. Are you serious?!$k$pYou think you can win a war with pretty\nideals and zero casualties? Wake up!$k$pYou think the war fairy is gonna come flying\nover and sprinkle victory dust everywhere?$k$p...This isn't about the plan at all, is it?\nYou're just making fun of ME!$k$p$E通常,|Well, I'm so sorry if I'm not as smart\nas my mother!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_10|Er, I think you're misunderstanding\nwhat I'm saying, Severa.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_18|Well I think you're being\na big, fat tactical jerk!$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wd$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_13|...Well, that could have gone better.\nBut at least now I see what this is about.$k\n$Sbs1000|

Hello, Severa.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_5|...Hey.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_27|I should apologize. For before. I...$k$pI shouldn't have been so quick to dismiss\nyour plan. I know you spent time on it.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_3|No, I'm sorry. I was immature and angry.\n...I didn't mean it when I called you fat.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_13|Heh, I admit, I did check myself on\nthe scales afterwards.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_17|Um, so, I thought more about the scenario,\nand I think I've got an answer.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_5|I'm all ears.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_18|What if we sent a scout group by air?\nLike pegasus knights or whatever.$k$pThey map out the area, nail down the\nenemy's position, and sniff out any traps.$k$pTHEN we send a ground force to take\nout the enemy.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_18|...That is a nuanced, well-considered plan.\nI'm quite impressed!$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_8|Right? The aerial units just avoid archers,\nand the ground troops aren't going in blind.$k$pIt's the perfect scheme!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_17|It's a B+ plan, with an A+ for effort!$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_4|......$k$pB PLUS?!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|It's a great idea, Severa, but the scenario\nwe ran at that meeting lacked air support.$k$pIn this hypothetical situation, there ARE no\npegasus knights or...whatever to send.$k$pThat's why we decided not to pursue the\nenemy in the first place.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_9|Y-you can't do this! You can't keep\nmaking up new rules all the time!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_17|Heh, sorry, Severa. Really I am.\nI thought that was clear from the start.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_3|Now I feel like a total idiot for wasting\nall that time thinking about it!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_14|Oh, I wouldn't call it a waste.$k$pConsidering a problem from different\nangles often leads to useful discoveries.$k$pIn fact, your answers have given me ideas\nfor new strategies down the line.$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_1|Yeah, my WRONG answers!$k$p$E怒,|Bah, I'm done talking about this!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_27|Hey, I'm sorry! Don't be mad,\nSevera! ...Come back!$k\n$Sbs1000|

Forcefully, usually...$k$pBut that doesn't really bother me.\nIn fact, I find it refreshing...$k\n$Wsセレナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERENA_EVT_5|Refreshing?!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_10|Sure! I mean, look at me. I'm pretty dull\nwhen you get right down to it.$k$pAnd even when you say something unkind,\nthere's still a bit of...
