I wonder why I have no memory\nof my mother...$k$pAll my memories of Father are so\ncrisp and clear...$k$pI remember what an amazing tactician he\nwas, all the time we studied together...$k$pBut nothing at all about my mother.\nIt's one big blank.$k\n$Wmミリエル|3$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Morgan?$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_98|Mother! That's amazing!\nI was just thinking about you!$k$pIs this fate?! This is totally fate!\nFamily-style fate!$k$p$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_13|...Wait, no. How did Father put it?$k$p"We're not pawns of some scripted fate.\nIt's the invisible ties we forge that bind us."$k$pSo yeah, it's not fate. It's the\nwhole invisible bond-link...thing!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|An unscientific analysis if ever I have\nheard one. But you seem convinced...$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Yup!
