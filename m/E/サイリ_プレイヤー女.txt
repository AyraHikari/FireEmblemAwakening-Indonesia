That seems a\nbit excessive, doesn't it?$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_22|Perhaps, but to the devotees of Teaism,\neven a lifetime of study is not enough.$k$pNot to worry, though―I'm not one of them.\nNow permit me boil the water...$k\n$Wc$Sbv40|1000|$Fo1000|$Sbv100|1000|$Fi1000|$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|......$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_6|Take this with care.\nThe cup is fearsome hot.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_16|Ooh, thank you!

Now, what could I talk about\ntoday? Something esoteric, perhaps?$k$pOh, I know. I could tell you of our art...$k$pFor Chon'sin artists, the most beautiful\nobjects are the old and broken.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_5|Truly?$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_6|Aye and aye again. Something in our\neye prefers the patina of age.$k$p'Tis but a different aesthetic.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|I've only ever thought of aesthetics\nto mean bright, beautiful things.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_4|Then I shall attempt to explain\nmy people's point of view.$k$pSomething that's old and worn is\ninfused with a certain beauty.$k$pA beauty of hard use, if it please you.\nOf decay and poverty.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_7|Poverty? ...That's a bit difficult to\nwrap my head around.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_22|It does require a new way of looking at\nthings, but it can be done.$k$pIn time, you'll appreciate the beauty of\nbrown, the allure of rust, the smell of mold.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_18|I think I prefer my art to be\ncolorful and clean.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_4|Aye, and to me, such things seem\ngarish and dull, both at once.$k$pI much prefer the honest poverty\nof simple, understated pieces.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_21|That's the second time you've\nused that word, "poverty."$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_6|The appreciation of poverty is an\nessential part of our culture.$k$pWe often say that poverty teaches us\nwhat is truly important in life.$k$pNot status, or standing, or possessions,\nbut a loving heart and positive spirit.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_13|Mmm, a lesson we should all appreciate.$k$pPeople who become rich are so often\nspoiled by their wealth and luxury.$k$pThey end up wanting more and more\nbut can never be satisfied.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_3|Aye! The Chon'sin interest in age and\ndecay is a reminder of that very point.$k$p'Tis a way to remonstrate with ourselves\nand appreciate what we already have.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_23|What a wonderful way of looking at things...\nI suppose it explains a lot.$k$pI've always admired how poised and\ngraceful you look when you fight.$k$pYou seem...centered. As if the little\nthings don't affect you.$k$pAnd now I understand why.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$E通常,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_17|You honor me, my lady.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_17|Heh, it's true though. I think we can\nall learn a lot from your country.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_22|I'm pleased you've come to think so. Truly.\nI hope one day you'll come visit.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_19|I'd like that very much.$k\n$Wsサイリ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SAYRI_EVT_5|Then we've one more reason to finish\nthis war and restore peace to the world!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_17|Yes we do.$k\n$Sbs1000|
