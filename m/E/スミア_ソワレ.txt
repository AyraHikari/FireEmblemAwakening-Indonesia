Do you like it?$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_5|It's wonderful! Thank you, Sully.$k$pDid I tell you I bought this tea from a\ntraveling merchant? It's a rare blend.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_6|Har! You don't see many merchants\nselling tea in these troubled times.$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_9|But troubled times are when people need a\nnice cup of tea most!$k$pThat's what the merchant said, anyway,\nand I'm inclined to agree with her.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_12|Works for me! Let's forget about war\nfor a bit and just have a nice chat...$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_10|Oh, yes, let's! That would be so nice!$k$pUm... So... What should we talk about?\nI told you everything I know about horses.$k$pI guess we could have some...girl talk?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_9|Oooo! Does little Sumia want to\nconfess her forbidden love?$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E苦,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_7|S-Sully! Shhhhhh!\nSomeone might hear you!$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_19|Har har! I saw right through you on\nthat one!$k$pC'mon, we're both women of the world,\nright? We know which way the wind blows.$k$pAnd what are friends for if not to hear\nconfession of a sultry midnight passion?!$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_17|Well it's hardly... Heh, all right, then.\nBut you have to go first!$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,汗照|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_2|M-me?! But I... I mean I don't...\nDammit, Sumia! That's hardly fair!$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_23|Hee hee! You're funny when you're\nflustered.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_5|W-well, it doesn't matter anyway.\nMy love life's duller than a sack of flour.$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_5|Heh, you're so shy all of a sudden!$k$pYou weren't like this when we\nwere talking about pegasi.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_7|Yeah, but that's a HORSE! I can talk\nabout horses all damn day.$k$pLove's just so... Er, you know?\nLovey.$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_8|...Would you rather talk about\nhorses some more, Sully?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_21|Hell yes!$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_スミア_ソワレ_Ａ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_HEIWA1_2|50|$t1$Wmスミア|7$Wmソワレ|3$w0|$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_9|Huh. When you put 'em side by side,\nthere's hardly any difference at all...$k$pIf not for the wings, pegasi and horses\nwould look exactly the same.$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_9|They even eat the same food! Maybe\nthey're cousins of one sort or another.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_2|It's just odd. How the hell did\npegasi end up with wings?$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_14|I've always wondered how\nthe horses lost theirs.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_8|Har! I never thought of it that way!\nIn either case, they're strange animals.$k$pAlthough I guess you can say that about\nalmost anything. Dragons... People...$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_10|I think that every creature is weird and\nwonderful in its own way!$k$p...Except cows. Cows just annoy me.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_13|When I was a kid, I was taught that the\ngods made all the world's creatures.$k$pSo then I asked who made the gods!\n...Har! That shut 'em up right quick.$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_8|Oh, I do so hate ponderous questions\nlike that.$k$pThey only serve to remind me how little\nwe know about anything.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_12|Yeah, I know how you feel.$k$pWe make up all these stories and legends\nto explain crap we don't understand...$k$pBut they usually make even less sense\nthan just saying "we don't know"!$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_19|That's how we end up fighting wars over\nideas. Because no one knows who's right.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_5|I guess war is inevitable when everyone\nhas their own version of the truth.$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_17|I'd like to think that one day we can\nlive in a world that doesn't know war.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_7|Know what? I think that day's coming.\n...And maybe sooner than you think.$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_14|That would give us more\ntime to drink tea!$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_12|And talk about horses!$k\n$Wsスミア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SMIA_EVT_8|Hee hee! Yes, of course.$k\n$Sbs1000|
