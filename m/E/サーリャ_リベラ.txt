I'll leave you to it.$k$pEr, but before I go, can I ask\nyou one thing?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_2|Make it snappy.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_7|How are you going to determine\nif the experiment is a success?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_18|I'll cast the hex on someone and see\nwhat happens. Same as always.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_13|In that case, I would like to volunteer\nto be your test subject.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_24|Oh? A priest wants to sacrifice himself\nfor the greater good? Shocker...$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_5|Unfortunately, my motives\nare largely selfish.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_17|Sure, whatever. I accept anyway.$k$pJust don't blame me if it all goes\nhorribly wrong.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_16|Er, is that a possibility?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_4|No curse is without danger.$k$pThere's always a risk of harm―\nto body AND to soul.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_2|I see. Then, I shall prepare for the\nworst, but hope for the best.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_23|Pray to whatever gods you believe in,\nPriest. ...This is going to be fun.$k\n$Sbs1000|

For example―$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_8|Hey! I'm calling the shots here.\nBut, er, just for fun...$k$pIf you could choose a new memory,\nwhat would it be?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_9|I'd like to remember a time spent with\ndoting parents in a warm, loving home.$k$pCould you conjure such a memory?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_18|That sounds positively nauseating.\nBut who am I to criticize?$k$pThink hard about the scene...\nVisualize it in your mind's eye...$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_2|Ah! I can see it now!$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_4|All right...here goes...$k$p...Nmmm...mmm...nnngh...$k$p$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_29|$E苦,汗|...What?

Well, I guess it didn't work.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_8|Maybe I'm the problem.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_20|No. It failed because I don't yet\nhave the talent and knowledge.$k$pEr, but Libra. When I cast the hex,\nI saw...$k$pWell, I saw a terrible darkness in you.\nWhat was that?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_12|...Ah. I see.$k$pI tried to hide it from you, but it\nappears I failed.$k$pMy hope was that your hex would\nextinguish it before you knew of it.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_5|So that's why you volunteered\nto be my guinea pig.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_11|As I said, my motives were selfish.\nI'm sorry for using you like this.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_10|No skin off my back.$k$pBut now I'm very interested in all\nthat darkness festering inside you...$k$pIf I could tap into it, it could power\nsome truly intense hexes.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_4|In that case, would you like to\ncontinue experimenting on me?$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_9|Doesn't it scare you to go\ndelving into that dark place?$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_16|I am beyond fear, dear Tharja.\nNothing can terrify me.$k\n$Wsサーリャ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SALLYA_EVT_17|A lot of dark mages would take\nsuch a boast as a challenge.$k\n$Wsリベラ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RIVIERA_EVT_11|Heh heh.
