Perhaps he is lost and confused?"$k$pBefore I heard the tired buffoonery and\nrecognized it was you, Basilio.$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_8|Old man? Old? Hah!$k$pBald and grizzled on the outside, yes, but\ninside beats the heart of a man half my age!$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_4|That act may work on the others,\nbut I know you too well, oaf...$k$pIsn't it time you dropped the charade\nand started acting your age?$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_11|Oh, damn it all... *sigh*\nI suppose you've got a point...$k$pI'm old enough to grandfather\nhalf the whelps in this army.$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_6|Did you know the youngsters have\ntaken to calling you "gramps"?$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_15|Why, the arrogant little...$k$pIn my day, we had RESPECT for our elders...$k$pNot one of those pups would dare face this\n"gramps" in a battle arena, I wager!$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_5|Assuming you can still find your way there.\nMemory is the first to go, you know?$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_18|You're no spring chicken yourself, woman!\n...That is, assuming you ARE a woman.$k$pI doubt anyone's ever managed to prize you\nout of that armor long enough to find out.$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_11|...Speaking of equipment, have I shown you\nmy new sword?$k$pI'm told it's sharp enough to slice through\nmail. Perhaps it's time I tested it...on YOU!$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_25|Gar, have a care where you swing that\nthing!

Well, well, Basilio. If I didn't know\nbetter I'd say you were up to something...$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_5|Look, do you want some or―$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_17|Yes.

You can tell old Basilio.\nMy only aim here is to know you better.$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_3|Hmm, you couldn't ply me with mead in any\ncase. I can drink you under the table.$k$pFine then... I suppose Chrom is quite\nhandsome, in his way.$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_9|Hmph. Not exactly a barrel of laughs, is he?\nAlways has his nose buried in those maps...$k$pNot to mention that hair! A bit much, don't\nyou think?

It's sharp enough to shave with...$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_14|*Gulp*$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_8|See? Feel the edge on your neck there?\nLook how those whiskers just fall away...$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_15|T-take it easy, Flavia. J-just put\nthat sword down and we can―$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_27|Keep talking? Yes, why don't we. I believe\nyou were saying something about my age?$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_25|Ur, yes, o-only how young and\nvibrant you look these da―$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_16|Enough, you simpering simpleton!\nGet out of my sight!$k$p...And leave the mead.$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_10|But...it's my last bottle...$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_17|And you're on my last nerve!

MID_支援_バジーリオ_フラヴィア_Ａ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_SERIOUS2_2|50|$t1$Wmバジーリオ|7$w0|$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$Wmフラヴィア|3$w0|$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_2|Ah, the siren returns... I knew you couldn't\nresist the old Basilio charm for long.$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_13|That's it, I'm leaving...$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_9|Wait! Don't go... 'Twas only a jest.$k$pI'd still like to talk. We had fun last time,\neh? ...At least until you drew your sword.$k$pTruth is, I was hoping we could speak\nabout the future of Regna Ferox.$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_6|You're not in charge anymore, oaf.\nYou had your day in the sun.$k$pI'm the ruler now, and any decisions\nto be made will be mine alone.$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_1|Aye, I grant that I've neither rights nor\nresponsibilities―the power is yours.$k$pBut I thought that as the former ruler,\nI might be able to offer advice and support.$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_12|Pah, I can only imagine the counsel\nyou would offer...$k$pWell then? Out with it. What is your\nsage advice, o wise bald one?$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_5|Regna Ferox is a cold land, and the chill\ncuts deep.$k$pOnce the war's over, you might consider\nmoving some subjects to a more pleasant―$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_10|Move people OUT of the kingdom?\nBut that would only serve to weaken us!$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_8|Indeed, in these times of strife and conflict\nit would be a foolish―nay, reckless act.$k$pBut once peace comes, why not give the\ninjured and the elderly a chance to rest?$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_15|Hmm... I suppose it could make\nfor a good boost to morale...$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_17|You see? I've lots more notions where\nthat came from, too. I'm full of them!$k$pA well-traveled man like myself has the\nexperience to think around corners.$k$pYou can gain loads of new ideas by\nstudying other cultures and customs.$k$pRulers should always visit other nations\nbefore taking the reins of their own land...$k$pAt least, that's how old Basilio sees it.$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_4|You speak wisdom, Basilio...$k$p*Ahem* Which frankly is completely\nout of character.$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_6|Hah! You raised your shield again,\nbut I caught a glimpse your true feelings!$k$pBe it to do with romance, mead, or matters\nof state, you enjoy my company! Admit it!$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_20|Yes, well... I won't deny that time spent\nwith you can sometimes be...interesting.$k$pStill, that doesn't change the fact that\nI now sit upon the throne!$k$pWhether I choose to take your advice\nor not is entirely up to me.$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_1|Heh, I'd have it no other way,\nO mighty Khan Regnant.$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_18|Well then, I look forward to hearing your\nother ideas when the time comes.$k\n$Wsバジーリオ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_BASILIO_EVT_22|We have a date, then. Though first,\nthere's a little war that needs finishing.$k\n$Wsフラヴィア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_FLAVIA_EVT_21|Yes, but even before that, this mead needs\nfinishing! I saved your last bottle!$k\n$Sbs1000|
