Don't tell me there\nwas a game on and I didn't get invited.$k$pCrivens, I haven't dealt in quite some time.\n*shuffle*$k$p$Eキメ,|Heh heh. I guess old Gaius Nimble Fingers\ncan still tickle the deck when he wants.$k\n$Wmミリエル|7$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|What was that?$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_14|Wargh! Don't sneak up on folk like that!\nCripes, I darn near bit my tongue...$k$pAnyway, I was just fiddling with these cards.\nUsed to be quite the player back in the day.$k$pThat is, until one fateful evening...$k$pThe evening I wagered and lost the finest\ncrowberry tart I ever saw.$k$pThe horrific memory haunts me to this day,\nand ever since, I've sworn off gamb―$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|I was not inquiring about your own\npersonal failings.$k$pI wanted to know how you made\nthat card vanish into the ether.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_4|What card?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|The card that was in your hand a moment\nago. The one with a regent's image.$k$pI saw it clearly, but now it is nowhere\nto be found.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_5|Oh, that? Heh heh. Just a little\ntrick I learned on my travels.$k$pSee? The card's in my right hand...\nThen I flip it like so...$k$pPresto! It's in my left!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Fascinating! You seem to have mastered\nthe legendary art of teleportation.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_12|What? Er, no, it's just sleight of hand.\nAnyone can do it with enough practice.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|...Sleight of hand? I am not familiar\nwith that particular discipline.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_10|It's all about deceiving the eye and\nfooling the senses. For example...$k$pTa-daaaaa! I just made a card appear\nout of nowhere.$k$p...Or so it seems. But I was actually\njust hiding it in my sleeve.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|Ah, I see. What an amusing hobby.$k$pDo you have any other tricks?\nI would be interested to see more.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_8|Interested enough to give me, say,\nthree peach pastries in exchange?$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ガイア_ミリエル_Ｂ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_ITAZURA1|0|$t1$Wmミリエル|7$Wmガイア|3$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Gaius, I would like to observe more\nof this sleight of hand of yours.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_14|Sorry, Specs. You saw every trick I know.\nBesides, I don't want to do more, anyway.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|...Specs? Ah yes, a reference to my\neyewear. How very amusing.$k$pBut why do you not wish to demonstrate\nmore of your talent? It is quite singular.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_9|Because you see right through my\ntricks. It spoils the fun!$k$p"Ah, Gaius! You have placed the card\ninside your codpiece!"$k$p"I say, Gaius! That coin can be\nlocated behind your third knuckle!"$k$pIt's seriously demotivating.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|I admit that I would be a difficult person\nto fool in this regard.$k$pYears of training have honed my powers of\nobservation into a sharply pointed rapier.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_4|Er, wait. You actually practice\nlooking at stuff?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Of course. It is an invaluable tool for any\nserious practitioner of science.$k$pThe first lesson of observation is that you\ncannot trust your perceptions.$k$pSensory impressions are mere constructs\nand easily distorted by preconceptions.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_12|Sooooo, folks see what they want to see,\nbut you taught yourself not to?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|The human mind can accomplish anything\nif one is sufficiently diligent.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_15|Got it. That explains why\nI can't fool you.$k$pWell then, maybe it's\ntime to get serious.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|Please explain.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_5|Well, I've been holding this one back.\nIn fact, I wasn't going to show you...$k$pBut as you've won every round so far,\nI reckon it's time to play my trump card.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|I did not realize we were engaged\nin a competition.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_10|Look, Specs, whenever you figure out\none of my tricks, that means I lose.$k$pAnd if I lose, I have to give your\npastries back. That's just honorable.$k$pBut this trick is veeery special.\nSo if you can't figure it out...$k$pYou have to buy me a treacle pie\nfrom the best baker in town.$k$pDeal? All right, here goes!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|It had not occurred to me that you might\nconsider the pastries some form of wager...$k$pBut very well, then. I accept.\nShow me your trick.$k\n$Sbs1000|

You look\nvery low today.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_9|If you're here to gloat, get on with\nit and then leave me alone.$k$pI'm out of tricks, Specs. I got nothing.\nZero. Zilch. Nada. Ix-nay.$k$pI don't even have any more\nsweets to wager.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Truly? You are completely out?\nI'd thought you to have a secret stash.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_5|Raided it last night. Cleaned it out\nin an eyeblink, I did.$k$pI've never been this long without sugar!\nI think I'm having heart palpitations.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|You misunderstand. I was speaking\nnot of sweets, but of card tricks.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_2|Oh. Well, you bled me dry\non those, too.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|Interesting. Perhaps then you\ncould think up some new ones.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_4|Oh, yeah, sure. I'll just reach down\nand pull 'em out of my...$k$pLook, why are you so interested\nin my card tricks, anyway?$k$pIt's not like I ever manage to fool you.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|It is a difficult reason to put into\nwords, but I shall attempt it.$k$pI found our competition to be stimulating.\nAlmost thrilling, in point of fact.$k$pMy senses were heightened like never\nbefore. It was a truly zesty experience!$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_13|Oh? You seemed pretty bored to me.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|I assure you, I was not. Your enthusiasm\nfor the game was quite infectious.$k$pMy skin tingled, my heart raced, and I noted\na dozen other signs of excitement besides.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_28|So there IS a bit of passion behind\nthat logical exterior of yours.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|That would be a fair proposition, yes.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_15|Oh, yeah. That passion just comes\nshining through...$k$pTell you what, Specs...$k$pIf you like playing that much, I'll try to\nconjure up some more tricks. All right?$k$p$Eキメ,|I may just have a couple of ideas...$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ガイア_ミリエル_Ｓ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_LOVE1|0|$t1$Wmミリエル|7$Wmガイア|3$w0|$Wsガイア|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_2|Hey, Specs. I've got one.\n...A new trick, that is. Care to play?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|There is nothing I would rather\ndo at this moment.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_5|So, I have a white handkerchief here, yes?\nJust a normal, everyday item.$k$pNow if you would be so kind, please drape\nit over your hand.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Like this?$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_8|Good. Now I'll just lift it off and...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Interesting. You have caused a ring\nto appear in the palm of my hand.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_15|Do you know why it's there?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|Because a ring is small and easy to\nconceal, thus lending the trick credence?$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_12|Uh, no. That's not what I―$k$pI don't mean HOW it got there.\nI mean WHY.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_10|Ah. I think I understand\nyour meaning now.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_10|Well, let me tell you the "why" first.$k$pBecause...these last few weeks have\nbeen the most fun I've ever had.$k$p$E笑,|I'm serious, Miriel. Even when I lost\npastries, I was just happy to be near you.$k$pMaybe it's the competition, or maybe it's\njust that you're beautiful. I'm not sure.$k$pBut anyway, I was thinking maybe you\nmight feel the same way, and so...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|You need not explain more.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_27|But I haven't finished my speech yet.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|I am most fascinated by this zest for\ncompetition you claim to have developed.$k$p...And the comment about beauty\ndid not hurt your cause either.$k$pAt any rate, I believe ours to be a\nrelationship worthy of further study.$k$p$E笑,|A marriage contract would suit my\npurposes very much indeed.$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_11|Th-that's great. I mean, really!\nFantastic!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|Now, Gaius...$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E笑,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_15|Yes, dear?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Will you show me how you managed to\nplace the ring on the palm of my hand?$k\n$Wsガイア|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_GUIRE_EVT_14|This better not be the only\nreason you said yes...$k\n$Sbs1000|
