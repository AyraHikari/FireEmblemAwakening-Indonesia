Phew...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Why do you repeat that same\nmotion over and over again?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_5|Have you never heard\nof shadow fencing?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_10|I assume it entails performing sword strikes\nand parries with an imaginary opponent.$k$pIs the point of the exercise pure kinetic\nstimulation, or is there more to achieve?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_13|Well, by making moves second nature,\nyou can perform them better and faster.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|Interesting. So the goal is to remember\nthe moves in your muscles, not your mind.$k$pI think this process warrants further study.\nWould you mind terribly much if I observe?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_11|In theory, no. But I've just finished\nfor the day and I'm exhausted...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|Ah. I see. That is disappointing.\n...Most TERRIBLY disappointing.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_14|B-but if you really want, I suppose\nI could run through a few more drills...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_20|I believe two hundred repetitions would\nbe sufficient to establish a baseline.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_7|T-two hundred? Good gods,\nI don't have the energy for that!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|...Most TERRIBLY disappointing.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa......$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_16|Well, I suppose I can find another,\nmore lucrative field of study.$k$pPerhaps I will just...observe this rock.\nYes, that should suffice.$k$pHmm... It's round. And smooth.\nWait! ...No, it's still round.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_15|ARGH! All right, all right. I'll do it.\nJust stop making me feel bad.$k$p*Sigh* Here we go.\nOne...two...th-three...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_21|Excellent.$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ソール_ミリエル_Ｂ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_ITAZURA1|0|$t1$Wmミリエル|7$Wmソール|3$w0|$Wsソール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_15|H-here's...the finish line...at last...\n*pant, pant* *wheeze*$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|Hmm... You circumnavigated the camp\nten times, and your total time was...$k$pFascinating!$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_14|M-Miriel... *pant* Every day...you grow\nmore like a demon...sent to torture me...$k$pHave you observed *wheeze* enough\nrunning now? Can I please stop?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|I see no harm in taking a short break.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_16|Phew... Thank goodness...\nSo...what *pant* did you learn?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|As you may know, I have been observing\neveryone's training, and not just yours.$k$pAnd in every measure of performance,\nyou come out at the exact median.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_5|I do?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Be it arm strength, running, stamina, or\nanything else, you are perfectly average.$k$pIf I didn't know better, I'd say that\nmy methodology was flawed.$k$pIt's something of a scientific miracle that\nyou can be so completely unoutstanding.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_17|Yes, well. That's just\nthe sort of man I am!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|You are aware of your ordinariness?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_11|Yeah, I've always tended to be more\nor less like everyone else.$k$pI do about the average amount of training\neveryone else does, but...you know. Meh.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Yet it is remarkable that you are able to\nprecisely hit EVERY statistical mean.$k$pYou must allow me to investigate further.\nAnd to do that, I need more data.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_5|D-do you mean...?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|Yes. Your break is over. Ten more\nlaps around the camp, please!$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_22|She IS a demon!$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ソール_ミリエル_Ａ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_HEIWA1_2|50|$t1$Wmミリエル|7$Wmソール|3$w0|$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_16|Ninety-eight...ninety-nine...\none hundred! Phew. All done!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|Fascinating. I've now directly observed\nthe results of your repetition drills.$k$pCompared with the first time I watched you,\nyour movements are smoother and faster.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_17|That's because you keep making me\ndo them over and over again.$k$pBut I wager I'm still only as good as\nhalf the people in camp, right?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_4|Yes. It is a most extraordinary result.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_5|Extraordinary? But I've always been\nSir Average! Why would that change?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|Because in recent days, all of your skills\nand statistics have improved dramatically.$k$pAnd yet, you remain in the very center of my\ngraph. See? At the top of this bell curve.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_7|Wait, wait. So while I got better, everyone\nelse ALSO got the exact amount better?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_6|Everyone in the army is aware that\nyou are the most average soldier.$k$pTherefore, when they see you improve,\nthey feel compelled to improve as well.$k$pIn this way, they are able to avoid\nfalling below the expected mean.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_10|I see... So it's not just a matter of me\nadapting to everyone around me...$k$pIt's about THEM seeing ME\nand adapting to THAT.$k$p$E笑,|Wow, thanks, Miriel! I'm way more\ninfluential than I ever imagined!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|I'm simply grateful for the chance to\nobserve such a fascinating phenomenon.$k$pI hope you will allow me to continue\nmy analysis and experiments?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_9|Of course. For as long as you like!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_21|Excellent.$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ソール_ミリエル_Ｓ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_LOVE1|0|$t1$Wmミリエル|7$Wmソール|3$w0|$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_16|$E通常,|Aaaaaand...finish line. *pant, pant*$k$p$E笑,|Heh heh. After this, everyone'll have to\nwork REAL hard to keep me average!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Stahl, you are blessed with\na most remarkable skill.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_7|You mean, a most average\nskill, don't you?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|The ability to be ordinary at everything\nis, in fact, most extraordinary.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_10|Er, well, I suppose that makes sense\nin a totally nonsensical kind of way.$k$pBut listen, I found something else\nabout me that isn't average...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|You have piqued my curiosity.\nPlease, edify!$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$Eキメ,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_11|This is difficult to put into words.\n...Er, especially to you. But let me try.$k$pThe other thing I'm not average at is...\nbeing in love with you.$k$pBecause without a doubt, I love you\nmore than anyone else in the world!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Is this a jape? Some manner of revenge\nfor my making you exercise?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_9|No jape, milady. The honest truth.\nAnd I have this ring to prove it.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|In other words, you wish to be my\nlifelong partner. Is that correct?$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_2|It means I want to be your husband!$k$pI admit, I used to hate all the running\nyou made me do.$k$pBut now I live for it. I can't wait to get out\nthere and jog or chop wood or whatnot!$k$pI like that you're always watching and\nmaking notes, and I want that to continue.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|And I, for my part, am anxious\nto continue my observations.$k$p$E笑,|And more importantly, I also harbor some\nmeasure of affection toward you.$k$pTherefore, I shall accept both your\nring and your proposal.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_17|I guarantee that when it comes to\nmarital bliss, we won't be average!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Interesting. For the first time ever, you\nstrive to be above average in something.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_18|That's right. And I know I can do it―\nbecause I love you, Miriel.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E,照|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Ah, yes. Quite. Thank you.\nI...um...also find you agreeable.$k\n$Sbs1000|
