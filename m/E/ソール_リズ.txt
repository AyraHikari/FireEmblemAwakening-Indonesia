At last!\nOh, many thanks for your help, Lissa!$k\n$Wsリズ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LIZ_EVT_15|Hey, no sweat.

I know from experience!$k\n$Wsリズ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LIZ_EVT_29|$E通常,|There you go again, giving people\nthe benefit of the doubt.$k$p$E怒,|Don't you think it's super annoying how\nboth our brothers treat us like servants?$k$pI mean, here we both are running from\nmarket to market buying stuff for 'em!$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_17|Heh! You have a point.$k\n$Wsリズ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LIZ_EVT_18|Of course I do! ...And I don't mind so\nmuch, but it's super unfair for you.$k$pYou're always helping other people,\nand you never get anything in return.$k\n$Wsソール|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SORT_EVT_12|Oh, but I do!
