I wonder why I have no memory\nof my father...$k$pAll my memories of Mother are so\ncrisp and clear...$k$pI remember what an amazing tactician she\nwas, all the time we studied together...$k$pBut nothing at all about my father.\nIt's one big blank.$k\n$Wmクロム|3$w0|$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_24|What are you up to, Morgan?$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_1|Father! That's amazing!\nI was just thinking about you!$k$pIs this fate?! This is totally fate!\nFamily-style fate!$k$p$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_24|...Wait, no. How did Mother put it?$k$p"We're not pawns of some scripted fate.\nIt's the invisible ties we forge that bind us."$k$p$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_11|So yeah, it's not fate. It's the\nwhole invisible bond-link...thing!$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_31|Heh, is that so?$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_3|Yup! Even without my memories, there's\nan invisible thread that links us.$k$pEr, but that reminds me...$k$p$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_23|I was just wondering how I could have\npossibly forgotten you, Father.$k$pDo you think maybe you could help\nme get those memories back?$k\n$Wsクロム|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHROM_EVT_6|I'd be happy to try. After all―$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_25|Yay! Thanks so much!

Right into my eyes.$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_4|Argh, that's perfect! You're a genius!$k$pI must have seen your face a million times\nin the future.$k$pIt's bound to bring SOMETHING back\nif I stare at it long enough.$k$p$Wsマーク男|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_11|Okay, sorry to invade your personal space\nhere, but...

Perhaps that's enough of the\nmemory project for one day?$k\n$Wsマーク男|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_14|Sure... I'm still a little dizzy from banging\nthe post earlier, to be honest...$k$p$Wsマーク男|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_M_EVT_25|But this doesn't end here!
