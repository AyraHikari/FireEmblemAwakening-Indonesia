Blue and purple...$k$pFavorite food? Probably bear meat...$k\n$Wmロラン|3$w0|$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|What are you going on about\nover there, Morgan?$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_11|Least favorite food? Veggies, apparently.\nDon't seem to mind them now, though...$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_6|Morgan!$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_13|Oh! Laurent?!$k$p$E笑,|Guess I was pretty out of it to miss\nmy own brother paying a visit!$k$pDid you need something?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_4|I was simply curious as to the reason\nbehind your frantic muttering.$k$pWere you perhaps practicing some\nnew magical incantations?$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_14|Nope! Just going back over my notes\non what you told me about myself.$k$pI was hoping they'd hold some clue\nthat might help spark my memory.$k$p$E笑,|Heh. It's kind of crazy how much you\nknow about me, huh?$k$pLike, I really once got five nosebleeds\nin the same day?$k$pI have no memory of that at all. AT ALL!\nHa ha ha! I can just imagine...$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|Ah, yes. Well, you're still as jocular\nand garrulous as ever...$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_18|I am? I mean, I was?!$k$pHmm, now that you mention it, that does\nsound...right, somehow.$k$p$E苦,汗|...Heh. Everything still feels funny. Even\nyou being my brother hasn't really clicked.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_9|If you think the experience odd for you,\nimagine how I perceive it...$k$pMy sibling starts speaking to me as if I were\na stranger, asking peculiar questions...$k$pIn truth, I was somewhat perplexed as to\nhow to even interact with you.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_17|Heh, yeah... Sorry about that.$k$pBut that's just another reason why I'm\nworking hard to get my memories back.$k$pOnce I do, nobody will have to feel\nweird or awkward around me again.$k$p$E通常,|Pretty noble, huh? I'm such a sweet,\nselfless girl!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_15|Indeed. And oh so humble...$k$p$E通常,|In any case, I'm happy to try and help you\nretrieve your memories however I can.$k$p$E笑,|It would be most satisfying to one day laugh\ntogether about old times―now included!$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Heh, right!$k\n$Sbs1000|

That was a fierce battle today.\nPerhaps I shall retire a bit ear...ly?$k$p$E怒,汗|Hmm? Is someone unconscious over there?\nWait, is that Morgan?!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wd$w0|$Wmマーク女|7$w0|$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_11|Nn...nngh...$k\n$Wmロラン|3$w0|$Wsロラン|$Wa$Eキメ,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_14|Morgan! Morgan, are you all right?!\nWhat happened?!$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_13|...Wha―?! Laurent!$k$p$E苦,汗|Wh-what am I doing here? Was I asleep?!$k$pI don't even remember feeling tired...$k$p$E笑,|Oh, right! I was bashing that huge tome\nagainst my head when I blacked out.$k$pThat explains why my face hurts so bad...$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|For the love of all that's holy, why in\nthe WORLD would you do that?!$k$pI postulate this was a misguided attempt\nto try and get your memories back?$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Well, yeah! Obviously.$k$pIf you ever saw me bludgeoning myself just\nfor fun, I hope you'd put a stop to it...$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E怒,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_21|I would have stopped you regardless\nof the reason, Morgan!$k$pI know you long to have your memories\nback, but you cannot place yourself at risk!$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_9|...But I want to be able to talk with you\nabout old times again.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_15|I know, and I desire that as well.\nBut more than that, I want you safe.$k$pI may just be another stranger to you,\nbut to me, you are family.$k$pIn the future, with Mother and Father gone,\nit was just the two of us.$k$p$E怒,|You're all I had, Morgan... I don't know\nwhat I'd do if anything happened to you.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_27|All right. I'm sorry, Laurent.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_16|Just as long as you understand.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_13|...Heh, that felt really siblingy just now.\nDon't you think?$k$pMe messing up and you scolding me felt...\nI don't know, it felt really plausible!$k$pMaybe if you keep it up, I'll remember\nsomething!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|An intriguing theory, but you fail\nto take into account―$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Yeah! Oh yeah, this will totally work!$k$p$E通常,|So go on, keep yelling! C'mon, scream at\nyour amnesiac sister, Laurent!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|Er, the causation for such a―$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_5|Hey, why don't you use the tome, too?$k$p$E怒,|Come on, don't hold back.\nReally wallop me with that thing!$k$pMaybe the simultaneous physical and mental\nshock will jar some memories loose!$k$pIt's gotta be twice as effective as either one\nby itself, right? That's just basic science.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_7|Now see here! There is no rational\nbasis for any of this!$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_マーク女_ロラン_兄弟_Ａ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_YASASHISA1|0|$t1$Wmロラン|3$Wmマーク女|7$w0|$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_4|I'm headed into town, Morgan.\nPerhaps you would care to join me?$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|I'd love to! Is there something\nin particular you need?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|I might pick up a couple\nof items, yes.$k$pBut mostly I believe there is\nsomething YOU need.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_5|It doesn't have to do with getting\nmy memories back, does it?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_9|The opposite, really.$k$pPerhaps there is no need to concern\nyourself with recovering your memories.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_7|That...makes no sense.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_15|In truth, the fact that you have\nforgotten me has been rather harrowing.$k$pBut...perhaps it would be better to build\nnew memories than to worry about old ones.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_10|What do you mean?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_6|I have formulated a hypothesis about your\npresent condition. Your amnesia, that is.$k$pI wonder if perhaps you didn't have some\nawful memory you couldn't bear to keep.$k$p$E苦,汗|...I know I have quite a few myself.$k$pI often see the faces of fallen comrades...\nInnocents we were unable to save...$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|......$k$p$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_27|I'm sorry you have to bear those\ndreadful memories, Laurent...$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E怒,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|Granted, it's just a hypothesis.$k$pEven if it were true, it's not like you could\nhave consciously suppressed your memories.$k$pBut I do believe that retrieving those lost\nmemories might cause unforeseen harm...$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_17|$E笑,|Hmm... I understand, and believe me,\nI appreciate the thought...$k$p$E通常,|But I want to remember things, no matter\nhow painful they are.$k$p$E怒,|Because I'm sure there'll be plenty of great\nmemories mixed with the bad ones.$k$pAnd the truth, whatever it is... I really\nwant to have that back, you know?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_10|Well, if you are certain,\nthen I'm happy to help.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_11|That's really kind of you, Laurent, but do\nyou truly realize what you're saying?$k$pI mean, it could be years before I\nremember anything. Or decades.$k$pHeck, there's a decent chance I may\nnever get my memories back at all.$k$pI don't want to drag you into something\nthat could last forever.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_16|As your brother, I am already sworn\nto you forever.$k$pWe are family―memories or no.\nYou couldn't keep me away.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_31|Laurent, I... *sniff* Thank you!$k$p$E笑,|I'll do everything I can!$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_19|Then start by accompanying\nme into town.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_5|Huh? But you said that doesn't have\nto do with getting my memories back.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|I am unaware of any rule that states you\ncan't enjoy a little fun while you try.$k$pAnd there's certainly no rule against making\nsome happy new memories, either.$k$p$E笑,|You are young and full of promise!\nThere will be ample time for worry later.$k\n$Wsマーク女|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARC_F_EVT_16|Right... You're right!\nThanks, Brother!$k\n$Sbs1000|
