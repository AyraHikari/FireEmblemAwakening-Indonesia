Yarne.\nGood, I found you.$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_15|GAH! D-don't DO that,\n$Nu!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_29|Do...what, exactly?\nDid I startle you? I apologize...$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_8|No, it's... Sorry, you're fine.\nDon't worry about it.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_5|You all right, Yarne? You know you can talk\nto me if something's bothering you, right?$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_11|...Did you need me for something?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_16|...Well, I just wanted to talk to you\nabout that last fight.$k$pCan you explain what happened?\nWhy you fled halfway through the battle?$k$pYou were more than a match for that foe.\nIt should have been an easy victory.$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_7|Maybe so, but there are no guarantees\nin war. You can never be too careful...$k$pI'm the last of the taguel, you know?!$k$pWhen I get to thinking I might go extinct,\nmy whole body just locks up!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_23|So that's it.$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_5|I can't take the fear. And if it's not the fear,\nit's the pressure!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_22|I can understand the survival instinct,\nespecially to protect the taguel line.$k$pBut in some situations, running like that can\nactually harm your chances for survival.$k$pSometimes the only way out is through. You\nhave to brace and face danger head-on.$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_15|My head knows that, but sometimes\nmy body just disagrees.$k$pI WANT to fight. Honest, I do, but...$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_11|...But the fate of an entire race is\nriding on your shoulders. I understand.$k$p$E笑,|Look, there's no rush. No one's asking\nyou to become fearless overnight.$k$pBut it's a serious issue, so I do ask you\nthink hard on it and how it can be solved.$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_4|...All right. I will.$k\n$Sbs1000|

But like I said,\nwe needn't rush a solution...$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_7|But I think I have one. I've thought on it,\nand I don't see running away as cowardice.$k$pYou know what's riding on my shoulders.\nIt's being the last of the taguel bloodline.$k$pThat's too important to risk. I don't belong\non the front lines.$k$pAs the last surviving member, my first\npriority should be staying alive.$k$p...Is that so wrong?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_14|Not at all. I don't want you to be reckless\nwith your life either.$k$p$E通常,|But you carry more than just taguel blood.\nYou carry their spirit.$k$pHave you ever stopped to think about\nhow your ancestors lived their lives?$k$pOr asked yourself if they would\nwant you to run?$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_12|How do you mean?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_22|They were persecuted and hunted down.\nEach and every one had to fight to live.$k$pIf they had all chosen to give up and\nflee, I bet you wouldn't be here right now.$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_15|You...you think so?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_M#_EVT_15|I do. And soon the day will come when\nyou have to fight as well.$k$pRunning from the fear of extinction was\nnever what kept the taguel alive.$k$pAnd frankly, I don't think it will help you\nrestore your race in the future.$k\n$Wsシャンブレー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_CHAMBRAY_EVT_5|......$k$p$E笑,|Maybe... Maybe you're right.\nI need time to think...$k\n$Sbs1000|
