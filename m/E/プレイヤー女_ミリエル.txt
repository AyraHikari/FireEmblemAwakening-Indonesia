Are you hurt?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|A minor contusion. Benign.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_9|Everything you were carrying went flying.\nI see your herbs, some papers, a...$k$pWhat is this? A book? A journal?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|Unhand that, madam!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_13|Sorry! Sorry. I didn't realize\nit was so important.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Important? Hmm...$k$p......$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_5|Miriel?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|I suppose it does bear some import, yes.$k$pIt's a lodestar, of sorts. One that points\nthe way to the truth.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_18|Wow. Who wrote it?\nA famous mage or something?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|Not famous at all, no.\nThe author was my mother.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_16|Ah, that explains the rough binding.\nEr, no offense intended.$k$pStill, that's amazing. Was your mother a\nmage as well? Or perhaps a scientist?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|What is the impetus\nfor your inquiry?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_5|Impetus for my...\nYou mean, why do I ask?$k$pEr, I don't know. ...I'm curious?\nWouldn't most people be?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|An autonomic reaction to\nconversational stimulus. I see...$k$p......$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|Um, did I say something strange?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|Curious, perhaps. Meriting closer study,\ncertainly.$k$pSpontaneous reactive curiosity. Fascinating.\nBut what is the underlying mechanism?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_9|...I really think you're reading\ntoo much into this.$k\n$Sbs1000|

My item pouch is gone.\nI must have dropped it somewhere...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Is this the object in question?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_13|Ah, yes! My thanks, Miriel.$k$pI keep it tied to my belt, but it's\nalways falling off for some reason.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Such actions are indicative of a pervasive\ndownward force exerted on the object.$k$pMy mother's book contained a passage\nespousing a similar theory...$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|So, um, can I have my\npouch back now?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|...Ah, yes. Here is the passage in question:$k$p$Eキメ,|"On all objects there acts a force which\npulls them ever groundward."$k$p"Though invisible and without apparent\ncause, it exists nonetheless."$k$p"I posit that it is by this principle\nwe remain rooted to the ground."$k$p...Most intriguing!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_19|...Miriel? ...Hello?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|...Yet birds fly unencumbered by this force.\nThe sun and stars and clouds do not fall.$k$pWhat explains these exceptions?$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|Miriel? ...Miiiriel?\n...MIRIEL!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|Wah!$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_13|S-sorry! ...Didn't mean to startle you.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|My respiratory functions ceased for a\nmoment. This is very disruptive.$k$pPlease do not scatter my thoughts further.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_27|Er, sorry...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_3|I require a period of quiet solitude to\nmarshal my thoughts. Farewell.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_13|Wait! My...pouch...$k\n$Sbs1000|

What are you doing\nwith my item pouch, Miriel?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_19|Experimenting in an attempt to establish\na unified theory of falling.$k$pWhether thrown, catapulted, or dropped\nfrom great heights, it falls to the ground.$k$pThe results have been consistent\nacross hundreds of trials.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_13|H-hey! I had a lot of fragile things in\nthat pouch! Potions and baubles and...$k$p*Sigh* ...You know what? Keep it.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_21|Thank you.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_9|Sometimes I wish you'd show half as much\ninterest in people as you do in science.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Well, I am interested in certain people.\nYou, for example.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_5|Me? Why me?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|You have a virtuosic proficiency in strategy,\ndespite your amnesia. It is truly fascinating.$k$pFrom this, we can extrapolate two possible\nhypotheses.$k$pOne: talent is wholly independent from\nmemory and experience.$k$pTwo: memories and experience related to\nthe use of one's talents cannot be lost.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_10|Miriel? Are you still talking to me?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|I am now, yes.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_5|Er, you're not going to tell me not to\ndisrupt your thoughts again?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|I can if you wish it.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_14|N-no, thanks. I'm just happy to know\nI wasn't a bother, I guess.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|That would be difficult. You are the focus\nof intense interest on my part.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_9|O-kay. I just don't like to think that\nI'm bothering a friend. That's all.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|I was unaware that our interactions had\nacquired the label of friendship.$k\n$Wsusername|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_PLAYER_F#_EVT_20|Why not? I think it must have happened\nsomewhere along the way, right? ...No?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|Fascinating...$k\n$Sbs1000|
