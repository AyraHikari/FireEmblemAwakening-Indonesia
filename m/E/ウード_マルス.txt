How does\nthe day find you?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_3|Good, good! Just thought\nI'd drop in for a visit.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_18|That's kind of you. But...\nWhy are you speaking so strangely today?$k$pThat is, so strangely...normal.\nYou're typically much more, er, colorful.$k$pMaking up stories and yelling and the like.\nAre you feeling all right?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_7|Y-yeah, I'm fine. It's just...$k$pYou're a princess, Lucina. I figured it wasn't\nexactly appropriate for addressing royals.$k$pPlus, Mom would tan my hide if she\never found out.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_22|Lissa would object to you spinning yarns\nfor royalty?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_8|Not just royalty! Anybody! She gets really\nupset whenever I do it.$k$pHeh, actually, I suppose most everyone\ndoes. They think I'm a bit batty.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_25|Do they now? That's a shame.\nPersonally, I find it quite intriguing.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_4|What, really?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_19|It's no simple feat to speak as you do\nwhen fantasy grips your mind.$k$pInventing weapon names and such requires\na rich vocabulary and quick thinking.$k$pAnd of course your stories demand a\nparticularly active imagination.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_15|I guess they do, don't they?\nThanks Lucina!$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_27|Perhaps you might even consider\ndemonstrating how you do it sometime?$k$pI've oft been told that my manner of\nspeech is somewhat...formal.$k$pIf I could learn to adopt your tone,\nit might prove useful to my own.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_4|Heh, you sound like you're asking me to\nteach you a foreign language.$k$pHmm... I'm not sure if this would be\nsuch a good idea...$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_21|And if I were to pledge never to speak\nof it to Lissa?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_20|...Then so be it! Prepare yourself,\nyoung Lucina! Your destiny cometh!$k$pHee hee, aw I can't wait.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_18|I look forward to it as well.$k\n$Sbs1000|

No obvious flaws...\nAha! Here's your problem!$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_21|You've found something?\nExcellent! Can it be rectified?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_10|Aw, this is easy. I've even got the\ntools I need with me.$k$pI'll take care of it right now.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_28|Wonderful. Thank you, Owain!$k$pCould I perhaps ask you to speak in\nyour fanciful manner as you work?$k$pIt would be good practice for my\nefforts to adjust my own tone.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_4|Heh! All right. I'll speak, and you\ncan practice translating...$k$pHark! Your partner fang resists the\nremorseless arrow of time!$k$pIt is infused with the breath of gods and\nthe passion of ages.$k$pShould a thousand thousand years pass,\nit shall never know the red sleep!$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_24|That one is simple.$k$pFalchion's blade will never dull or rust\nno matter how much time passes.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_24|But where fang meets sinew,\nFalchion remains a mortal work.$k$pEven genius cannot hope to stop\nthe turning of the great wheel!$k$pAnd so it is reborn with each generation;\ntransformed, but ever the same in spirit.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_26|Hmm... But parts of the sword other than\nthe blade DO wear out over time.$k$pThe guard and pommel have been replaced\nover the years, changing its appearance.$k$pBut it remains Falchion still.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_4|Perfect! That was exactly right.\nYou're amazing, Lucina.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_28|I suppose I did a fair job for a first time.\nBut you are the amazing one, Owain.$k$pTo discover all that about a sword from\na single glance is a fearsome talent indeed!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_20|Eh, taking care of weapons is kind of\na hobby of mine. Oh, hold on...$k$p...Aaaaaand we're done! Here you go.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_38|Thank you again.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_8|My pleasure. Just let me know if\nthere's anything else I can do.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_19|Perhaps I will take you up on that.$k\n$Sbs1000|

I can really feel the difference.$k$pNever hath I spied Pointy\nDemonspanker shine so brightly!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_4|Pointy... Wait, did you say\nDemonspanker?$k$pBut that's Falchion! Treasure of the\nroyal house of Ylisse! ...Er, right?$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_12|It was. But as it has been reborn so\nmany times, I thought to change its name.$k$pI tried to think of what you would call it.\nI pray my efforts were adequate.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_1|*Giggle* Hmm, uh... Heh heh, so...\nNo, I mean, it's a fine name. But, well...$k$pThe cause to give one's blade a fitting\nname is a noble one, Lucina.$k$pHOWEVER! You committed a grave sin!$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_22|I did?!$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_24|To name a weapon is to imbue it with a\nsoul.$k$pTo change Falchion's name is to insult\nthe spirit it's borne for millennia!$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_15|I...did not consider that.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_22|In your commendable haste to make the\nsword more dear to your own heart...$k$pI fear you've stripped the very\nsoul from your weapon!$k$pThough your intentions were laudable,\nthis slight must be undone.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_24|Yes, of course. I see now how\nthoughtless it was of me.$k$p...Pray forgive me, Falchion.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_18|It is done. The blade's rightful name is\nrestored.$k$pBut do not forget the love that spurred you\nto this brief folly. Keep it with you always.$k$pAnd if you find yourself in need of\nmaintenance, simply call out my name!$k$pHeh... I mean, just in case... *giggle*\nPointy Demonspanker needs it...$k$pPffffft! Bwa ha ha ha!$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_18|I'm starting to suspect you didn't\ntruly think it was such a fine name...$k\n$Sbs1000|

Certainly, Owain.\nYou're awfully formal today...$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_7|There's something I'd\nlike you to have.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_21|Oh?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_8|Here.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_17|...A sheath?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_10|It should fit Falchion.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_13|A thoughtful gesture, Owain,\nbut Falchion already has a sheath.$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_18|Yes, I know. And it's as old and worn as\nthe pommel I fixed the other day.$k$pI thought maybe it was time to retire it.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_38|You're always so thoughtful, Owain.\nThank you. You do too much for me...$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_3|Please, it's my pleasure.\nPlus, it's good for the sword...$k$pBecause I was thinking it\ncould serve as my proxy.$k\n$Wsルキナ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MARTH_EVT_10|How do you mean?$k\n$Wsウード|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_EUDES_EVT_22|There's no telling what the war holds for us.$k$pI probably won't always be there to\nfight at your side when you need me.$k$pBut your sheath will always be there.
