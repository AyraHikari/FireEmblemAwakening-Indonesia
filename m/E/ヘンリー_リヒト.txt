Thanks so much for\ncoming to my rescue the other day.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_1|Sure! It's what I do.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_17|Having a mighty mage like you in our\nranks makes me feel a lot safer.$k$pGood thing for us you aren't fighting\nfor the other side.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_9|$E笑,|Well, I used to work for Gangrel, so if\nyou hadn't defeated him, who knows?$k$pYou and I might have been squaring up\non the ol' battlefield. Nya ha ha!$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_20|I didn't know you were\nwith the Plegian army!$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_4|$Eキメ,|Oh? I thought word had gotten around.$k$pYeah, Gangrel was toppled before I got\nthe chance to fight any real battles.$k$pA shame, too. It would've been fun to\nface off against the Shepherds!$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_7|But we're the good guys...$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_24|Oh, Chrom and Frederick are nice soldiers\nand all, but I wager I could take them both!$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_14|H-Henry! That's treason!$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_5|Is not.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_11|W-well even if it isn't, people might get\nthe wrong idea.$k$pThey'll start thinking you ARE an enemy,\nand then we'll end up fighting for real.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_8|Neat! We could see whose\nmagic is stronger.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_15|HENRY! You're my ally! I don't\nwant to fight you.$k$pBesides, if we were mortal foes, we\nwouldn't be able to talk like this.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_7|Weeell, I guess it's kinda fun being\non the same side as you...$k$p$Eキメ,|All right. I guess I'll stick with the\nShepherds―for now, at least.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_12|I should hope so!$k\n$Sbs1000|

You've cut down a few\nof my former comrades.$k$pYou interested in who they were?\nLemme see if I can recall...$k$pWell, there's Vasto. I liked him!\nAlways ready with a joke or quip.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_6|That guy?! He tried to stop us when\nwe headed east that one time.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_1|He was really excited about that posting―\nit was his first major command.$k$pHa! He used to talk about his mother all\nthe time. "Best knitter in Plegia," he'd say!$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_14|Oh. That's...nice.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_19|Then there was Mustafa. He always gave\nme a bag of peaches whenever I visited.$k$pHe said I reminded him of his son and that\nI should consider myself part of his family.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa......$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_2|Oh! And Campari used to make little\nbirdhouses for homeless―$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_15|Actually, Henry? I don't think I want\nto know about your comrades after all.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_5|Aw! I thought you were interested.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_7|I was, but now everyone seems more...\nnormal than I expected.$k$p$E通常,|They're not maniacs or monsters.\nThey're just like us, except they're dead.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_9|Yep. Dead as driftwood, they are.\nAnd it was you Shepherds who killed 'em!$k$pTheir friends and families are probably\nstill crying their eyes out.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_14|......$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_11|What's wrong?$k\n$Wsリヒト|$WaHenry, it's my job to kill Plegian soldiers...\nSo I have to believe they deserve to die.$k$pBut now you've reminded me that they\naren't faceless blobs with axes.$k$pThey have friends, and families, and...$k$pH-how am I going to fight them if I know\nthat? What if I hesitate?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_4|You're weird. I don't see the\nproblem here at all.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_17|No, it's all right, Henry.\nIt was my fault for asking.$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ヘンリー_リヒト_Ａ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_HEIWA1_3|800|$t1$Wmヘンリー|7$Wmリヒト|3$w0|$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_13|Henry, can I ask you a question?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_6|Judging by your expression, I'd say\nit's a serious one. Nya ha ha!$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_6|Er... Do you remember when we talked\nabout the Plegian soldiers we've killed?$k$pAnd how some of them used to be your\ncomrades and friends?$k$pDon't you...resent us?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_5|Resent you? Shucks no.\nWhat good would that do?$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_7|Um, none, I suppose. It wouldn't be\ngood for anyone, you included.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_7|Exactly! So I decided not to.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_12|But how can you just brush it off\nlike that?$k$pIf I were cut down in battle tomorrow,\nwould you just shrug and carry on?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_3|No! I'd be very sad and angry.$k$pAnd I'd find out who did it, hunt them\ndown, and exact bloody revenge!$k$p...Oh yes. There would be blood.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_14|But you just said you don't resent us\nand there's no point in holding grudges.$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_4|Oh yeah. I DID say that!\nI wonder what the difference is...$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_2|Er, are you asking me?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_1|When I was with Plegia, I didn't think\nmuch about this kind of thing.$k$pMaybe because in that army, I didn't\nhave real friends like I do here.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E通常,|Do you think of me as a friend?$k\n$Wsヘンリー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_HENRI_EVT_22|I guess, sure. Honestly, I'm not much\ngood with touchy-feely stuff.$k$pYou know what I'd rather talk about?\nThe next battle!$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_17|I suppose it wouldn't be bad to\nplan a little strategy.$k$pIn the end, victory is the only thing\nthat can justify all this death...$k\n$Sbs1000|
