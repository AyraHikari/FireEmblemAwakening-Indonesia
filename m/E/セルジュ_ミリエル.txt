Good girl, Minerva!$k\n$Wmミリエル|3$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|...?$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_9|Oh, hello, Miriel.$k$pHow long have you been standing\nthere staring at Minerva?$k$pYou seem utterly entranced.\nDo you like wyverns?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|No. Not at all.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_16|Oh, all right... You don't have to\nbe so blunt about it, you know.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_20|...My apologies.$k$pI was absorbed in my observations and\nforgot others desire a modicum of tact.$k$pThat wyvern you have there appears\nto comprehend human speech.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_3|She's a very smart girl.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|I've read reports which claimed that ancient\ndragons possess the power of language.$k$pHowever, I'd not heard that living\nwyverns were capable of such feats.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_13|Well, sounds like you've stumbled upon\nthe discovery of the century, then!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Perhaps. Although it will still need to\nbe peer-reviewed before publication.$k$pWill you allow me to continue observing\nthe creature and further expand my thesis?$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_17|Sure, we wouldn't mind that.\nWould we, Minerva?$k$p......$k$pShe says that would be fine.\n...She also likes your hat.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_21|Fascinating.$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_セルジュ_ミリエル_Ｂ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_HEIWA1_2|50|$t1$Wmミリエル|3$Wmセルジュ|7$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Now, Minerva. What's this?$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_8|...She says it's an apple.\nDid I tell you she loves apples?$k$p$E笑,|Her favorite snacks are live goats,\nbut apples run a close second.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_10|I see. Tell me, Minerva,\nhow old are you now?$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_3|...She says she just turned 20.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|Interesting.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_17|So, what do you say, Miriel? Ready to go\npublic with the discovery of the century?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|No. I'm afraid I will have to rewrite my\nentire thesis based on new information.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_6|Oh? How so?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|It is clear the subject, Minerva, does in\nfact respond to human language.$k$pHowever, there is no causational evidence\nthat she understands the words themselves.$k$pIt is also evident that you and the beast\nshare a special and unique bond.$k$pMost-like this connection enables a mutual\ngrasp of thoughts, emotions, and intent.$k$pIn conclusion, there is but one rational\nexplanation for Minerva's apparent skill.$k$pThe answer lies with you, rather than\nthe wyvern.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_16|$E笑,|With...me?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_6|You are the only person able to engage\nin this direct communication.$k$pOther humans can no more talk to\nMinerva than to a lizard or squirrel.$k$pRather than a talking wyvern, I believe I've\ndiscovered a human that speaks wyvern.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_7|That's not so special. Many humans say\nthey can communicate with their pets.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Hmm... I'd not considered it in such a light.\nClearly more investigation is warranted.$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_セルジュ_ミリエル_Ａ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_HEIWA1_2|50|$t1$Wmミリエル|3$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_20|Hmm. It appears that Cherche\nis absent today.$k\n$Wc$w500|$SspSE_EVT_DRAGON_VOICE1|$w1500|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|$E怒,|Two decibels louder and you would have\ncaused permanent hearing loss, Minerva.$k$p$E通常,|I assume you are expressing displeasure\ncaused from hunger, yes?$k$pI have an apple here in my sleeve.\nWould you like it?$k$p......$k$p$E苦,汗|......$k$pCould you please release my arm from\nyour jaws before it is torn off?$k\n$Wmセルジュ|7$w0|$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_6|Minerva, stop that!\nLet go of her arm!$k$p$E通常,|Oh, I'm SO sorry, Miriel!\nAre you all right?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_5|I am fine. Clearly she meant no injury,\nelsewise I would be less the arm.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_17|Hee hee...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|I fail to see the humor in the situation.$k$pWere I a barrister, I could take you\nfor all that you were worth.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_11|I'm sorry. I was just thinking how nice\nit is that you two have become friends.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|Friends? Do you think so?$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_3|How did you know she was hungry\notherwise?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|It was a logical assumption.\n...Wait. No, it was not.$k$pFascinating. Perhaps I am acquiring\nyour knowledge of wyvernspeak?$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_7|Nope. It just means that when you get to\nknow a wyvern, you start to understand her.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|I'd not considered that such a thing might\nbe possible for the layperson.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_9|Apparently so.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|How utterly fascinating!$k$pI must now expand my investigation\nto include myself as a subject.$k$p$E通常,|That is, if you will allow me to\ncontinue to interact with Minerva?$k$pIn fact, I hope you will be my partner in\nwhat is becoming a fruitful field of inquiry!$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_16|Well, it's not just up to me.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_10|Ah, of course. ...Minerva, will you\ncontinue to help in my research?$k\n$Wc$w500|$SspSE_EVT_DRAGON_VOICE1|$w1500|$Wsミリエル|$Wa......$k$p$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_17|I believe that was affirmative.$k\n$Wsセルジュ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SERGE_EVT_18|It certainly was!$k\n$Sbs1000|
