That's good for now.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|......$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_6|You're awfully quiet over there, Miriel.$k$pCome to think of it, I don't think I've\never seen you practicing spells.$k$pSo, I guess you just read and think?\nA lot?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|Vigorous thought suits me.\nThere is less grunting.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_7|But don't you want to actually try\nout the stuff you're learning?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_4|The testing of hypotheses through\nexperimentation is of paramount import.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wd$w500|$Wmミリエル|7$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa......$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_13|Um, Miriel? What did you\njust grab?$k$pWhy are you staring at a\nglass of water?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_29|I've immersed two distinct metals in\nthis solution. Now to apply a charge...$k$pTHUNDER!$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_20|Gah!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvjSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_25|$SveSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_17|Success! How pleasant.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_2|Whoa! They both look like the same\nmetal now. How'd you do that?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_6|It's merely a thin coating of particles freed\nfrom the sample by the spell's energy.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_10|I have absolutely no idea what\nthat means, but it's still amazing!$k$p$E通常,|So does that have some kind of\ncombat use or something?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|None whatsoever.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_15|Oh! That's...kind of weird.$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ミリエル_リヒト_Ｂ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_HEIWA1_2|50|$t1$Wmミリエル|7$Wmリヒト|3$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Administer the spell to the charcoal,\nif you please.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_21|Got it. ...Hyaaa!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa......$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_10|Whoa.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvjSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_25|$SveSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_17|...And success! How nice.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_1|Wait, hold on! Why did it glow like that?\nAnd why was it that color?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_6|This is another byproduct of\nthe spell's magical energy.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_6|Sooo, I don't suppose this has any\ncombat applications either?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvjSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|$SveSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|Absolutely none.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_13|And since the thunderbolt already glows,\nwhy bother with the coal at all?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|Practical use is not my concern. I conduct\nexperiments to uncover natural truths.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_7|Gee, I never really stopped to\nthink about anything like that.$k$p$E通常,|So, what's the next experiment?\nAnything I can help with?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|I welcome your assistance, but as I said,\nit is likely to be of dubious use at best.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_16|Aw, that doesn't matter. Let me help!\nThis is real cutting-edge stuff.$k$pI mean, maybe you'll find some\namazing use for it after all.$k$pPlus we're tossing lightning bolts\naround, and that's fun!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|Heh. It is good to see one so young\nenjoying science. Let us proceed.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_8|Yes, ma'am!$k\n$Sbs1000|
MID_支援_ミリエル_リヒト_Ａ: $SbpSTRM_BGM_EVT_HEIWA1_2|50|$t1$Wmミリエル|7$Wmリヒト|3$w0|$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_29|And...begin.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_21|Nrrraaagh!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa...Curious.$k$p$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|$E通常,|As hypothesized, the same tome yields\ndifferent results based on the user.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_7|Well, yeah. That's because you're\na stronger mage than me.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_4|But what is magical prowess, specifically?\nWhat factors determine its development?$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_6|Well, it's... I mean, it's like that\none thing where mages...$k$pHmph. You know? I've never even\nstopped to think it through.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|A complex, multicausational phenomenon\nto be sure, but a fascinating line of inquiry.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_1|You're always asking questions other\npeople haven't even thought of.$k$pWhere do you come up with this stuff?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|My research is based predominately on\nthe writings of my mother.$k$pTo her final day, she documented every\nphenomenon and natural law she observed.$k$pSome called them the ravings of a\nmadwoman, but I saw crystalline insight.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_10|And now you want to prove her right!$k$pWe're not that different, you know?\nI'm fighting for my family's name, too.$k$pWe used to be one of Ylisse's high noble\nhouses, but times have been hard lately.$k$pIt's up to me to come home a war hero\nand rebuild our reputation!$k$pSo if there's anything I can do to help,\njust say the word.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_17|Likewise.$k\n$Sbs1000|

That's great.$k$pBut actually, I'd like to help in all your\nexperiments from now on, if that's okay.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|In perpetuity? That would be a great\nhelp indeed.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_10|Well then... Um... Here.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|A ring? How curious.$k$pAre you proposing we melt it down\nto ascertain its composition?$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_11|I'm proposing you marry me!$k$p$E笑,|Then we could work side by side\nforever.$k$pAnd that's important because...\nI think I've fallen in love with you.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|Most fascinating.$k$p$E笑,|Your words acted as an aural cue causing a\nsuffusion of warmth to permeate my chest.$k$pThis demands further exploration. I shall\nneed your help for another experiment.$k\n$Wsリヒト|$Wa$SvjSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_18|$SveSE_VOICE_LICHT_EVT_8|I'd love to!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_17|I hypothesize this will be a highly\neducational partnership.$k\n$Sbs1000|
