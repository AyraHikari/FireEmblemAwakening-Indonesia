She IS my mother.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_11|Well, yes, but still...$k$pYou two are so alike, I sometimes wonder\nif you inherited anything from me.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_3|Don't be absurd, Father.\nOf course I did.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_5|...Like?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Like...the color of my hair.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_8|Well, yes, but that's not\nwhat I meant.$k$pAnything more substantive? Maybe you\nhave trouble with women as I do?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_11|Hmm, no. My bearing in that respect\nis profoundly normal.$k$pVery much to my relief, if I might be\nperfectly frank.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_13|See, that's what I mean. You're always\nso serious and verbose...$k$pYou could stand to loosen up a bit.\nMaybe act a bit more your age.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_27|We're at war, Father. Acting like a child\nis hardly behavior to be encouraged.$k$pBesides, I'm a grown man. Older than\nLucina at this point, I suspect.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_7|Wait, how could you be older than\nLucina?$k$pShe's already been born here, but your\nmother and I still haven't had you.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_15|I...I fear I've no more time to chat today.\nNow, if you'll excuse me.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wd$w0|$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_12|...What was all that about?$k\n$Sbs1000|

How may I help you?$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_11|I was thinking about how you said\nyou were older than Lucina...$k$pCare to explain?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_7|It's fairly straightforward. Travel among\neras is imprecise. There are...variables.$k$pLucina arrived at the onset of the war with\nPlegia some two years ago.$k$pI, on the other hand, have been here for\nnearly five years.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_7|There's that much of a difference?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_8|...Indeed.$k$pHence, I have aged three years more than\nshe in the course of reaching this moment.$k$pSomewhere along the way, I passed her\nin terms of physical age.$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_12|So you've been in this era for\nfive years all by yourself?$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_2|Yes. So as you see, I'm far too old to be\nindulging in childish behaviors.$k$pI trust that explanation has cleared up\nyour confusion? Now, if you'll excuse me...$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_13|Laurent, wait. Why have you never\nmentioned any of this before?$k$pYou were cut off from everyone else for five\nwhole years. You must have been...lonely.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_LAURENT_EVT_13|As I've said time and again,\nI am a grown man.$k$p...I managed fine on my own.$k\n$Wsロラン|$Wd$w0|$w500|$Wsロンクー|$Wa......$k\n$Sbs1000|

No one to lend an\near to my despair. It was...awful.$k$pMany nights, I thought I'd die alone.\nThat the pain would kill me, or...$k\n$Wsロンクー|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_RONKUU_EVT_16|...I'm sorry I didn't find you earlier,\nLaurent.
