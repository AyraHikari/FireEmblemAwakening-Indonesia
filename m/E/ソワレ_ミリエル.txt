Just the girl\nI wanted to see.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|Greetings and salutations, Sully.\nAre you in need of assistance?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_7|You're an egghead, right? You like\nresearching and investigating things?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Why, yes. Unlocking the mysteries and\nwonders of the natural world gives me―$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_8|Yeah, yeah, whatever.\nLook, I have a favor to ask.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E怒,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|...You wish me to develop a new\nweapon? Something of that ilk?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_13|Naw, nothing like that.\nI want you to study ME!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E苦,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_14|You? Well, that would be most unusual...$k$pI confess, I had never considered you\nas a possible field of research, but...$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_11|Yeah, well, maybe it's time you\nconsider it. $k$pYou might have noticed that I'm\nnot like other women, right?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|If you are speaking of your martial prowess,\nthen yes, it is a known quantity.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_16|Er, yeah! Right! That!\n...And some other stuff, too.$k$pLook, I just want you to figure out\nwhat's so different about me.$k$p$E怒,|I mean, I TRY to fit in, I really do,\nbut something sets me apart.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_2|I see. You wish me to observe your social\ninteractions and verbal communications.$k$pIn this way, I might see behavioral signifiers\nthat differentiate you from the group norm.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_6|That is probably exactly what I'm saying!\n...I think.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|I need time to prepare my queries and\nform a control group. Is this acceptable?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_19|Er, sure. Whatever you just said.\nWhatever it takes.$k\n$Sbs1000|

How's the research\nproject going?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|I have many such projects underway, but I\nassume you refer to your personality study.$k$pSince we talked, I have been observing you\nwith fierce scientific rigor.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_2|Wait, really?\nI didn't even notice.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_6|If the subject is aware of the observation,\nthe results would be compromised.$k$pIt was vital that I observe you in your\nnatural habitat.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_12|Oh yeah? ...So?\nAny conclusions?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|During the observation phase, two main\npoints came to my attention.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_16|...Well what the hell\nare they already?!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|The first is your language.\nThe second is your general bearing.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_13|You mean the way I walk\nand talk and crap like that?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|Your clothing and armor are unexceptional\nand fit within Shepherd social norms.$k$pHowever, your use of language―especially\nvulgarity―is quite irregular.$k$pAlso, you tend to carry yourself in a\nvery aggressive manner.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_8|O-kay.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_10|If you wish to fit in with others, I would\nrecommend change in these two areas.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_5|Aw, come on!\nThat's horse plop!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_1|I assure you my conclusions were\nreached via scientifically proven methods.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_11|I've had people tell me this before!$k$p"You have to do this!"\n"You gotta act like that!"$k$pIt never works! I pretend for a week\nor so and then just give it up.$k$pWho says we all have to act the same,\nanyway? Who made all these damn rules?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|I believe they are based on social mores\nas opposed to a natural law.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_12|Well, hell...$k$pI'm gonna have to think on this\none for a bit.$k$pThanks for doing the observation stuff.\nHope I didn't waste your time.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_13|Not at all.\nIt was quite fascinating.$k\n$Sbs1000|

And?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_7|Now then. Suppose you need to extinguish\nthis fire. How would you do it?$k$pYou are allowed to use anything you see\naround you.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_12|Er, I guess I'd use\nthat bucket of water.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_9|You would pour water\non the fire?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_19|Well, sure. Water on fire,\nfire goes out. Right?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_4|Very well.\nPlease go ahead.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_24|Ha!

What the heck did you do?!$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$Eキメ,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_6|The fluid in the bucket is a substance\ncommonly known as "kindling water."$k$pIt is a mysterious liquid that emerges\nfrom the ground near distant mountains.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_16|Kindling water?$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_12|$E通常,|Just now, you made the assumption\nthat water always douses fire.$k$pHowever, you failed to consider that\nthere may be different kinds of water.$k$p$E笑,|It may also interest you to know that people\nwho live near kindling water find it useful.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_8|...I get it. It's different than regular\nwater, but still useful to some folks.$k$pAnd people who are different may still\nhave useful roles to play.$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E笑,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_8|Precisely. My research indicates that you\nshould be happy just the way you are.$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_22|Heh. Thanks for the pep talk, Miriel.\nI feel better already.$k$pAlthough, I do still have one question...$k\n$Wsミリエル|$Wa$E通常,|$SvpSE_VOICE_MYRIEL_EVT_11|Yes?$k\n$Wsソワレ|$Wa$E苦,汗|$SvpSE_VOICE_SOIREE_EVT_13|How the hell are you planning\non putting out this fire?!$k\n$Sbs1000|
